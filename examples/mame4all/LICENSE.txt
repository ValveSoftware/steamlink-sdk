          Copyright (C) 1997-2000 by Nicola Salmoria and The MAME Team

Many people have helped with this project--directly, or by releasing the source
code for the drivers they have written. We are not trying to take credit that
isn't ours. See the Acknowledgments section for a list of contributors. Please
note, however, that the list is largely incomplete. Also see the comments in
the source code to see the people who contributed to specific drivers. That
list, too, may be incomplete. We apologize for any omission.

All trademarks cited in this document are property of their respective owners.


Usage and Distribution License
------------------------------

I. Purpose
----------
   MAME is strictly a non-profit project. Its main purpose is to be a reference
   to the inner workings of the emulated arcade machines. This is done for
   educational purposes and to prevent many historical games from sinking into
   oblivion once the hardware they run on stops working. Of course to preserve
   the games, you must also be able to actually play them; you can consider
   that a nice side effect.
   It is not our intention to infringe on any copyrights or patents on the
   original games. All of MAME's source code is either our own or freely
   available. To operate, the emulator requires images of the original ROMs
   from the arcade machines, which must be provided by the user. No portion of
   the original ROM codes are included in the executable.

II. Cost
--------
   MAME is free. Its source code is free. Selling either is not allowed.

III. ROM Images
---------------
   ROM images are copyrighted material. Most of them cannot be distributed
   freely. Distribution of MAME on the same physical medium as illegal copies
   of ROM images is strictly forbidden.
   You are not allowed to distribute MAME in any form if you sell, advertise,
   or publicize illegal CD-ROMs or other media containing ROM images. This
   restriction applies even if you don't make money, directly or indirectly,
   from those activities. You are allowed to make ROMs and MAME available for
   download on the same website, but only if you warn users about the ROMs's
   copyright status, and make it clear that users must not download ROMs unless
   they are legally entitled to do so.

IV. Source Code Distribution
----------------------------
   If you distribute the binary (compiled) version of MAME, you should also
   distribute the source code. If you can't do that, you must provide a link
   to a site where the source can be obtained.

V. Distribution Integrity
-------------------------
   This chapter applies to the official MAME distribution. See below for
   limitations on the distribution of derivative works.
   MAME must be distributed only in the original archives. You are not allowed
   to distribute a modified version, nor to remove and/or add files to the
   archive.

VI. Reuse of Source Code
--------------------------
   This chapter might not apply to specific portions of MAME (e.g. CPU
   emulators) which bear different copyright notices.
   The source code cannot be used in a commercial product without the written
   authorization of the authors. Use in non-commercial products is allowed, and
   indeed encouraged.  If you use portions of the MAME source code in your
   program, however, you must make the full source code freely available as
   well.
   Usage of the _information_ contained in the source code is free for any use.
   However, given the amount of time and energy it took to collect this
   information, if you find new information we would appreciate if you made it
   freely available as well.

VII. Derivative Works
---------------------
   Derivative works are allowed, provided their source code is freely
   available. However, these works are discouraged. MAME is a continuously-
   -evolving project. It is in your best interests to submit your contributions
   to the MAME development team, so they may be integrated into the main
   distribution.
   There are some specific modifications to the source code which go against
   the spirit of the project. They are NOT considered a derivative work, and
   distribution of executables containing them is strictly forbidden. Such
   modifications include, but are not limited to:
   - enabling games that are disabled
   - changing the ROM verification commands so that they report missing games
   - removing the startup information screens
   If you make a derivative work, you are not allowed to call it MAME. You must
   use a different name to make clear that it is a MAME derivative, not an
   official distribution from the MAME team. Simply calling it MAME followed or
   preceded by a punctuation mark (e.g. MAME+) is not sufficient. The name must
   be clearly distinct (e.g. REMAME). The version number must also match the
   number of the official MAME version from which you derived your version.


How to Contact Us
-----------------

The official MAME homepage is http://www.mame.net/  You can always find the
latest release there, including beta versions and information on things being
worked on. Also, a totally legal and free ROM set of Robby Roto is available
on the same page.

If you have bugs to report, check the MAME Testing Project at
http://www.mametesters.com

Here are some of the people contributing to MAME. If you have comments,
suggestions, or bug reports about an existing driver, check the driver's
source code to find who has worked on it, and send comments to that person.
If you are not sure who to contact, write to Nicola. If you have comments
specific to a system other than DOS (e.g. Mac, Win32, Unix), they should be
sent to the respective port maintainer (check the documentation to know who he
is). DON'T SEND THEM TO NICOLA - they will be ignored.

DON'T SEND BINARY ATTACHMENTS WITHOUT ASKING FIRST, *ESPECIALLY* ROM IMAGES.

THESE ARE NOT SUPPORT ADDRESSES. Support questions sent to these addresses
*will* be ignored. Please understand that this is a *free* project, mostly
targeted at experienced users. We don't have the resources to provide end user
support. Basically, if you can't get the emulator to work, you are on your own.
First of all, read the docs carefully. If you still can't find an answer to
your question, try checking the beginner's sections that many emulation pages
have, or ask on the appropriate Usenet newsgroups (e.g. comp.emulators.misc) or
on the official MAME message board at http://www.mame.net/msg/

For help in compiling MAME, check these pages:
http://www.mame.net/compile.html
http://www.mameworld.net

Also, DO NOT SEND REQUESTS FOR NEW GAMES TO ADD, unless you have some original
info on the game hardware or, even better, own the board and have the technical
expertise needed to help us.
Please don't send us information widely available on the Internet - we are
perfectly capable of finding it ourselves, thank you.

Without the Repository, I would never have even tried to write an emulator.
Unfortunately, the original Repository is now closed, but its spirit lives
on in MAME.

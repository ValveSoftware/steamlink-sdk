;  -Extra Description line for above (29 characters max)
;******************************************************************************
;NOTES: The cheat descriptions use the following terms, this is what they
;       actually mean:
;
;Get+Now! means the cheat is a type 01 cheat and so it is a temporary cheat - 
;         it changes the memory and then deactivates. Type 01 is ideal for 
;         getting a particular weapon or feature, also needed for a Finish 
;         Level Now! cheat.
;
;Always   means the cheat is permanent (several cheat types) idea for always
;         having a certain weapon or feature eg always have 3 rainbows on 
;         Rainbow Islands.
;
;Infinite means exactly what it says - you will have an inexhaustible supply of
;         the named item be it lives, time, ammo or something else. On some
;         rare occasions you may need to deactivate the cheat before you can 
;         finish a level, if this need to be done you will see F5 at the end
;         of the cheat description. NB: If using this cheat.dat with a version
;         of MAME before 34B6 you will need to use F7 instead of F5.
;
;With the release of MAME 0.34B6 there is support for fully selectable level
;cheats, thanks to JCK's source code improvements - she's doing a wonderful
;job. Basically, there are two types of level select cheats and a score cheat:
; 
;Select current level  - Select a level and you can progress to it by losing a
;                        life. You should only activate this type of cheat 
;                        during game play or according to the comments.
;
;Select next level - Select a level and when you complete the current level you
;                    will progress straight to the selected level. You can also
;                    activate this on the title/attract screens though the
;                    effects cannot always be guaranteed! (you will either
;                    start on the selected level or the next level after the
;                    selected one or level 1). A far better method if you want
;                    to select the starting level from the title screen is to 
;                    use the method that I thought of for Metrocross. See 
;                    Metrocross remarks for info.
;Select Score - This cheat allows you to select your score or/and the other 
;               player's score, ideal for sports games where you need a certain
;               score to win and/or progress. It must ONLY be activated during
;               game play. Also note the score may not display correctly until
;               the score has changed properly!

exterm:0:0019293D:74:001:Determines HealthPL1 location
;
;How to find EXTERMINATOR cheats from Rodney Norton (BOTH METHODS)
;METHOD 1:
;
;This game is weird. EVERY time you play, no matter if u die, restart (F3) or 
;quit MAME and restart it the memory location changes that stores your life. I 
;have found an easy way to find the position each and every time (sorry, only 
;way to do it for now).
;
;Start a game and when you are fully into the game search for this value:
;            120 (078)
;
;Now each and every time the bar moves down ONE notch, its a reduction by ONE 
;! So shoot until the bar drops one notch, and search for (077). This should
;give you only ONE memory location.
;
;Another way is too search for (078)(using the health search), and shoot until 
;you lose one notch of life/health/what ever the h**k it is. Then search for
;changed -001. Do this several times and you will be left with just one mem 
;location as well.
;
;
;METHOD 2:
;
;It's not perfect, and at current rate it never will be.  Until the cheat 
;engine gets an overhaul, we're stuck with mediocrity...
;
;Heres the locations, I'll explain how to get them working...
;
;exterm:0:00192F20:78:000:Infinite Health PL1
;exterm:0:0019293D:74:001:Determines the mem location for PL1 health
;
;Ok, here's an explanation of why...  0019293D is the memory location that 
;chooses which of the 16 or so mem locations store the health for either 
;player.  I am guessing there must be another choosing location, and I'll look 
;for that later.
;The Value of '74' corresponds to 00192F20.  I have mapped out most of the mem 
;locations and their corresponding values, as well, so changing it is not a 
;problem.
;
;Now, the main problem is we cannot set 0019293D as a static 74, it appears to 
;be reused once inside the game.  Setting it static causes the game to crash.  
;Setting it once has problems too.  We have to set it at exactly the right time 
;for it too be effective !  This is the tricky bit.
;
;Do this, and you're set:
;
;Start the game
;Press [F3]
;When the screen goes green PAUSE
;Activate the 0019293D cheat (The game will freeze on this green screen)
;Press [3] [1] [3], one after another
;Press [F3] (resets)
;Now start a game [1]
;Mem location 00192F20 should now contain 78.  Now activate the inf health 
;cheat
;
;If you can find an easier way, please let Rodney know !!
;AND ME!! pugsy@usa.net

;New way of doing a Select starting level cheat, this method should work on
;most games. As long as the first cheat conforms to that shown here. In other
;words, take the 'Select next level' cheat rename it to 'Select starting level (2/2)'.
;Then make a new cheat called 'Select starting level (1/2)' which uses the same
;location as the 2/2 cheat but pokes it with 'FF' or some other unlikely value
;[PLEASE KEEP THIS TO FF AS IT WILL BE EASIER TO FIX IF THE CHEAT ENGINE IS AMMENDED!],
;you should make sure the Cheat type is '021' as this will allow the two cheats
;to be active at the same time - essential for this cheat to work!!
;
;The comments may change according to the game, for example in Metrocross the game will
;enter attract mode if a coin is not inserted and this will screw up the cheat
;as it will reset the memory location to zero. However, for most games it shouldn't
;matter if you enable the cheat on the title screen, the player select or the attract
;screens. Poke the value of the level to something like '05' [not '00' or '01'!] on the
;title screen then put a watch on it - if it changes at all then you will need to add
;a comment to show the problem area or when the cheat should be enabled. If there's no
;problem area then the first 4 comment lines are sufficient. Feel free to interchange
;level, round and stage whenever the game calls them that.
;
;This is cheat method is just a workaround, ideally there should be a new cheat
;type to implement this so the comments would be largely unneeded. However, as
;nobody is improving the cheat engine at the moment this will have to do!
;
;These remarks will stay in until a new cheat type is implemented. [Pugsy:19 DEC 99]

;Not a slideshow but still rather easy, particulary if you combine the Infinite
;Lives, Slow Ball and Bonus Finish Level cheats.
;Open issues:
;- catch every bonus OR catch the ball always - would need a cheat type capable
;  of reading the value at one location (found) and write it at another one, 
;  this could be used for several other games, too... cheat engine enhancement
;  anyone?
;- Bigger Ball. There are a couple of locations easily found with contain 0,1
;  or 2 (the three sizes), but patching those won't do a thing... where's the
;  trigger ?
;- Finish Level Now!. There's a counter with the exact number of tiles 
;  remaining, however it seems to be a copy of something else yet to find since
;  patching it won't do a thing, it becomes reset immediately.

;*********************************************************************************************
;Cheats required : 
;
;The following games do not yet have cheats for at least one of the following
;reasons:-
;
;1. The game has not yet been properly emulated by MAME. Some games which are
;   broken still have cheats - however, if it's NOT properly emulated and no
;   good cheats could be found then reason 1 will be quoted over all other 
;   reasons.
;
;2. I don't know what cheats to find as the game is hard to understand and is
;   perhaps in a another tongue - eg Japanese. Or the the game doesn't appear
;   suitable for cheat finding. 
;
;3. I haven't had chance to look at the game for one reason or another - 
;   A  GET OUT! ;-) 
;
;4. The game has had no RAM areas set up to search in for cheats even with a
;   SCAN ALL AREAS! A lot of cinematronics games currently have this problem 
;   as only 1 ROM area is defined!
;
;5. The game was only recently fixed and I haven't had a chance to find any
;   cheats yet.
;
;6. I've got cheat(s) for the game but I haven't had chance to test them or do
;   the cheat description(s).
;
;7. I've had a quick look at this game and it seems suitable for cheat finding,
;   there's RAM set up - but even a simple search for an Infinite Lives cheat
;   didn't turn up any cheats after whittling down the locations.... These can 
;   be taken as a challenge!!!
;
;8. The game was added in one of the last versions and I haven't had chance to
;   find any cheats yet. If there is no reason quoted, then it is for this
;   reason.
;
;9. The game was not in the last official releasable beta binary, some of these
;   'unofficial' games have cheats (Metal Slug X), but this reason is primarily
;   for games that are playable and are likely to make it to a beta binary
;   release soon. This reason will be rarely used!

;* Basically this is an alphabetical list of clones, so even although area88  *
;* is a clone of UN Sqauadron it is listed after area88. Also some of the     *
;* games are not listed by MAME as clones but they are, at least from the     *
;* perspective of cheats - which is why this is here!                         *

; Cheats requiring more work (and time......) :-
; Rework cheats with ';' comment lines to cheat type 999 wherever a better
; explanation is required (not Use Sprite when flickers type comments as this
; will overcomplicate matters for now) - ONGOING
; Look at Ali Baba - uses pacman hardware may use same cheats...
; Look at Aurail - round 2 looks to be a different game - cheats may not work 
; after round 1...
; Check out all the Neo Geo fighting games like Samurai Shodown, it appears that
; the energy cheats don't work - looks like an 'Exterminator' situation.
; More cheats for Finest Hour
; Look at The End - invincibility can be improved for starters 
; Check out weapon cheats for Finalizer
; Look at Mirai Ninja
; Punisher weapon cheats - if possible
; Look at replicating Mania Challenge cheats for The Main Event
; More Kung Fu Master cheats
; Spy Hunter 2 needs more cheats!
; The Return of Ishtar needs more work - present cheats has problems in b12 ...

; time then me could look at some working weapon cheats! ;-P Also need to double

; Moon Patrol - look at non-crazy Invincibility, problem is 02 gives invincibility
; but doesn't let you jump, 04 let's you jump - masking off 02 and 04 only doesn't
; help either. Maybe another location too to clear up the sprite problem. 
; Gauntlet - look at replicating Freeze All Enemies cheat for all Gauntlet Clones

; Dream Soccer '94 - look at Select Score cheats for PL1 and penalty kickoff cheats
; Add Score always, score now! or select score cheats for games with only one type (perhaps)
; Gotya - find invincibility cheat + others
; Kodure Ookami - find invincibility and weapon(?) cheats + level select if poss.
; Labyrinth Runner - weapon cheats required + level select
; Passing Shot - check all cheats, order make them hard to understand.....(I hate Tennis games)

;  locations should be 2 part (like time)

transistor, logic gate designs:
NMOS (M65xx)
CMOS (M65Cxx)
HMOS (M75xx) hyper? MOS, used in early c16/plus4 series
H2MOS (M85xx) hyper2 MOS, used in C128, late C64
?SCMOS (M65SCxx) Super? CMOS
?CE (M65CExx, M45xx) CMOS Enhanced?, used in not released C65

HMOS, H2MOS CPUs have the same core as the NMOS series

6500 / 6501
mask programable microcontroller
32 io ports (2 interruptable)
timer
64 byte ram
8 kbyte rom

6502 (used in many designs)

6508
8 io pins (p0 bis p7)

6509
4 io pins (p0 bis p3)
1megabyte memory management???

6510/8500 (used in some designs)
6 io pins (p0 bis p5)

6510T (used in commodore C1551 floppy)
8 io pins
integrated clock generation?

7501/8501 (c16, c116, c232, c264, plus4, c364)
7 io pins (no p5)
no nmi

8502 (c128)
7 io pins (no p7)

the above series is opcode compatible (including illegal opcodes)

65c02 (used in some designs)
no illegal opcodes from the above series
so not full compatible to 6502 series
additional commands

n2a03 (some arcades)
(nintendo variant without decimal mode?)
m65c02 compatible (except decimal mode)?

65sc02 (where used?)
65c02 compatible
additional commands

gte65816 (nintendo snes)
65802 upgrade cpu (c64 and c128 upgrade cpu)
16 bit wide registers
65c02? compatible mode
additional commands

huc6280 (nec pcengine)
65sc02 compatible?
8 memory registers
(highest 3 bits select memory register, these build a22..a13)
(so 2 Megabyte address room!)
additional commands?

65ce02 (c65 prototype)
(cpu core to be used in asics)
65sc02 compatible
z register
(65c02 zeropage indexed addressing is now (zeropage),z)
b bank register, highbyte of all zerozape addressing
register for stack high byte
additional command (some from the 65816)

Commodore C65 CPU (4510)
65ce02 compatible
integrated memory management (not in standard m65ce02!)

Set Overflow Pin
in 6502 and pin compatibles (65C02 65SC02 65SC802 65CE02), M6509
no SO pin 6510/7501/8500/8501/8502/65sc816
6510T ?

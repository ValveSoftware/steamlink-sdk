6.4.1 Certificates
------------------

Server certificate authentication
.................................

When using certificates the server is required to have at least one
certificate and private key pair. Clients may not hold such a pair, but
a server could require it. In this section we discuss general issues
applying to both client and server certificates. The next section will
elaborate on issues arising from client authentication only.

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_allocate_credentials:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t *      RES)'

`VOID *note gnutls_certificate_free_credentials:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t SC)'

After the credentials structures are initialized, the certificate and
key pair must be loaded. This occurs before any TLS session is
initialized, and the same structures are reused for multiple sessions.
Depending on the certificate type different loading functions are
available, as shown below.  For X.509 certificates, the functions will
accept and use a certificate chain that leads to a trusted authority.
The certificate chain must be ordered in such way that every
certificate certifies the one before it. The trusted authority's
certificate need not to be included since the peer should possess it
already.

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_mem2:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const gnutls_datum_t * CERT, const gnutls_datum_t * KEY, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE, const char * PASS, unsigned int FLAGS)'

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, gnutls_x509_crt_t * CERT_LIST, int CERT_LIST_SIZE, gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY)'

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const char * CERTFILE, const char * KEYFILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE, const char * PASS, unsigned int FLAGS)'

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key_mem:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t            RES, const gnutls_datum_t * CERT, const gnutls_datum_t * KEY, gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t FORMAT)'

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, gnutls_openpgp_crt_t CRT, gnutls_openpgp_privkey_t PKEY)'

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t      RES, const char * CERTFILE, const char * KEYFILE, gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t FORMAT)'

Note however, that since functions like *note
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2:: may accept URLs that specify
objects stored in token, another important function is *note
gnutls_certificate_set_pin_function::. That allows setting a callback
function to retrieve a PIN if the input keys are protected by PIN by
the token.

 -- Function: void gnutls_certificate_set_pin_function
          (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, gnutls_pin_callback_t
          FN, void * USERDATA)
     CRED: is a `gnutls_certificate_credentials_t'  structure.

     FN: A PIN callback

     USERDATA: Data to be passed in the callback

     This function will set a callback function to be used when
     required to access a protected object. This function overrides any
     other global PIN functions.

     Note that this function must be called right after initialization
     to have effect.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

If the imported keys and certificates need to be accessed before any
TLS session is established, it is convenient to use *note
gnutls_certificate_set_key:: in combination with *note
gnutls_pcert_import_x509_raw:: and *note
gnutls_privkey_import_x509_raw::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_certificate_set_key
          (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const char ** NAMES,
          int NAMES_SIZE, gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT_LIST, int
          PCERT_LIST_SIZE, gnutls_privkey_t KEY)
     RES: is a `gnutls_certificate_credentials_t'  structure.

     NAMES: is an array of DNS name of the certificate (NULL if none)

     NAMES_SIZE: holds the size of the names list

     PCERT_LIST: contains a certificate list (path) for the specified
     private key

     PCERT_LIST_SIZE: holds the size of the certificate list

     KEY: is a `gnutls_privkey_t'  key

     This function sets a certificate/private key pair in the
     gnutls_certificate_credentials_t structure.  This function may be
     called more than once, in case multiple keys/certificates exist for
     the server.  For clients that wants to send more than its own end
     entity certificate (e.g., also an intermediate CA cert) then put
     the certificate chain in  `pcert_list' .

     Note that the  `pcert_list' and  `key' will become part of the
     credentials structure and must not be deallocated. They will be
     automatically deallocated when the  `res' structure is
     deinitialized.

     *Returns:* `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) on success, or a negative error
     code.

     *Since:* 3.0

If multiple certificates are used with the functions above each
client's request will be served with the certificate that matches the
requested name (see *note Server name indication::).

As an alternative to loading from files or buffers, a callback may be
used for the server or the client to specify the certificate and the
key at the handshake time.  In that case a certificate should be
selected according the peer's signature algorithm preferences. To get
those preferences use *note gnutls_sign_algorithm_get_requested::. Both
functions are shown below.

`VOID *note gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function * FUNC)'

`VOID *note gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function2:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function2 * FUNC)'

`INT *note gnutls_sign_algorithm_get_requested:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, size_t INDX, gnutls_sign_algorithm_t * ALGO)'

c The functions above do not handle the requested server name
automatically.  A server would need to check the name requested by the
client using *note gnutls_server_name_get::, and serve the appropriate
certificate. Note that some of these functions require the
`gnutls_pcert_st' structure to be filled in. Helper functions to fill
in the structure are listed below.

typedef struct gnutls_pcert_st
{
  gnutls_pubkey_t pubkey;
  gnutls_datum_t cert;
  gnutls_certificate_type_t type;
} gnutls_pcert_st;

`INT *note gnutls_pcert_import_x509:: (gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT, gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT, unsigned int FLAGS)'

`INT *note gnutls_pcert_import_openpgp:: (gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT, gnutls_openpgp_crt_t CRT, unsigned int FLAGS)'

`INT *note gnutls_pcert_import_x509_raw:: (gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT, const gnutls_datum_t * CERT, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, unsigned int FLAGS)'

`INT *note gnutls_pcert_import_openpgp_raw:: (gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT, const gnutls_datum_t * CERT, gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, gnutls_openpgp_keyid_t KEYID, unsigned int FLAGS)'

`VOID *note gnutls_pcert_deinit:: (gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT)'

In a handshake, the negotiated cipher suite depends on the
certificate's parameters, so some key exchange methods might not be
available with all certificates. GnuTLS will disable ciphersuites that
are not compatible with the key, or the enabled authentication methods.
For example keys marked as sign-only, will not be able to access the
plain RSA ciphersuites, that require decryption. It is not recommended
to use RSA keys for both signing and encryption. If possible use a
different key for the `DHE-RSA' which uses signing and `RSA' that
requires decryption.  All the key exchange methods shown in *note Table
4.1: tab:key-exchange. are available in certificate authentication.

Client certificate authentication
.................................

If a certificate is to be requested from the client during the
handshake, the server will send a certificate request message. This
behavior is controlled *note gnutls_certificate_server_set_request::.
The request contains a list of the acceptable by the server certificate
signers. This list is constructed using the trusted certificate
authorities of the server.  In cases where the server supports a large
number of certificate authorities it makes sense not to advertise all
of the names to save bandwidth. That can be controlled using the
function *note gnutls_certificate_send_x509_rdn_sequence::.  This
however will have the side-effect of not restricting the client to
certificates signed by server's acceptable signers.

 -- Function: void gnutls_certificate_server_set_request
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_certificate_request_t REQ)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     REQ: is one of GNUTLS_CERT_REQUEST, GNUTLS_CERT_REQUIRE

     This function specifies if we (in case of a server) are going to
     send a certificate request message to the client. If  `req' is
     GNUTLS_CERT_REQUIRE then the server will return an error if the
     peer does not provide a certificate. If you do not call this
     function then the client will not be asked to send a certificate.

 -- Function: void gnutls_certificate_send_x509_rdn_sequence
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION, int STATUS)
     SESSION: is a pointer to a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     STATUS: is 0 or 1

     If status is non zero, this function will order gnutls not to send
     the rdnSequence in the certificate request message. That is the
     server will not advertise its trusted CAs to the peer. If status
     is zero then the default behaviour will take effect, which is to
     advertise the server's trusted CAs.

     This function has no effect in clients, and in authentication
     methods other than certificate with X.509 certificates.

Client or server certificate verification
.........................................

Certificate verification is possible by loading the trusted authorities
into the credentials structure by using the following functions,
applicable to X.509 and OpenPGP certificates.

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_system_trust:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t       CRED)'

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t            CRED, const char * CAFILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE)'

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_keyring_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t C, const char * FILE, gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t FORMAT)'

The peer's certificate is not automatically verified and one must call
*note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3:: after a successful handshake
to verify the certificate's signature and the owner of the certificate.
The verification status returned can be printed using *note
gnutls_certificate_verification_status_print::.

Alternatively the verification can occur during the handshake by using
*note gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function::.

The functions above provide a brief verification output. If a detailed
output is required one should call *note gnutls_certificate_get_peers::
to obtain the raw certificate of the peer and verify it using the
functions discussed in *note X.509 certificates::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3 (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, const char * HOSTNAME, unsigned int * STATUS)
     SESSION: is a gnutls session

     HOSTNAME: is the expected name of the peer; may be `NULL'

     STATUS: is the output of the verification

     This function will verify the peer's certificate and store the
     status in the  `status' variable as a bitwise or'd
     gnutls_certificate_status_t values or zero if the certificate is
     trusted. Note that value in  `status' is set only when the return
     value of this function is success (i.e, failure to trust a
     certificate does not imply a negative return value).  The default
     verification flags used by this function can be overridden using
     `gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags()' . See the documentation of
     `gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2()'  for details in the
     verification process.

     If the  `hostname' provided is non-NULL then this function will
     compare the hostname in the certificate against the given. The
     comparison will be accurate for ascii names; non-ascii names are
     compared byte-by-byte.  If names do not match the
     `GNUTLS_CERT_UNEXPECTED_OWNER'  status flag will be set.

     In order to verify the purpose of the end-certificate (by checking
     the extended key usage), use `gnutls_certificate_verify_peers()' .

     *Returns:* a negative error code on error and `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'
     (0) on success.

     *Since:* 3.1.4

 -- Function: void gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function
          (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED,
          gnutls_certificate_verify_function * FUNC)
     CRED: is a `gnutls_certificate_credentials_t'  structure.

     FUNC: is the callback function

     This function sets a callback to be called when peer's certificate
     has been received in order to verify it on receipt rather than
     doing after the handshake is completed.

     The callback's function prototype is: int
     (*callback)(gnutls_session_t);

     If the callback function is provided then gnutls will call it, in
     the handshake, just after the certificate message has been
     received.  To verify or obtain the certificate the
     `gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2()' ,
     `gnutls_certificate_type_get()' , `gnutls_certificate_get_peers()'
     functions can be used.

     The callback function should return 0 for the handshake to continue
     or non-zero to terminate.

     *Since:* 2.10.0

6.4.2 SRP
---------

The initialization functions in SRP credentials differ between client
and server.  Clients supporting SRP should set the username and password
prior to connection, to the credentials structure.  Alternatively *note
gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials_function:: may be used instead, to
specify a callback function that should return the SRP username and
password.  The callback is called once during the TLS handshake.

`INT *note gnutls_srp_allocate_server_credentials:: (gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t *            SC)'

`INT *note gnutls_srp_allocate_client_credentials:: (gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t *            SC)'

`VOID *note gnutls_srp_free_server_credentials:: (gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t SC)'

`VOID *note gnutls_srp_free_client_credentials:: (gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t SC)'

`INT *note gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials:: (gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t RES, const char * USERNAME, const char * PASSWORD)'

 -- Function: void gnutls_srp_set_client_credentials_function
          (gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t CRED,
          gnutls_srp_client_credentials_function * FUNC)
     CRED: is a `gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t'  structure.

     FUNC: is the callback function

     This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the
     username and password for client SRP authentication.  The
     callback's function form is:

     int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, char** username, char**password);

     The  `username' and  `password' must be allocated using
     `gnutls_malloc()' .   `username' and  `password' should be ASCII
     strings or UTF-8 strings prepared using the "SASLprep" profile of
     "stringprep".

     The callback function will be called once per handshake before the
     initial hello message is sent.

     The callback should not return a negative error code the second
     time called, since the handshake procedure will be aborted.

     The callback function should return 0 on success.  -1 indicates an
     error.

In server side the default behavior of GnuTLS is to read the usernames
and SRP verifiers from password files. These password file format is
compatible the with the _Stanford srp libraries_ format.  If a
different password file format is to be used, then *note
gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function:: should be called, to set
an appropriate callback.

 -- Function: int gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_file
          (gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t RES, const char *
          PASSWORD_FILE, const char * PASSWORD_CONF_FILE)
     RES: is a `gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t'  structure.

     PASSWORD_FILE: is the SRP password file (tpasswd)

     PASSWORD_CONF_FILE: is the SRP password conf file (tpasswd.conf)

     This function sets the password files, in a
     `gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t'  structure.  Those password files
     hold usernames and verifiers and will be used for SRP
     authentication.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned, or an
     error code.

 -- Function: void gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function
          (gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t CRED,
          gnutls_srp_server_credentials_function * FUNC)
     CRED: is a `gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t'  structure.

     FUNC: is the callback function

     This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the user's
     SRP credentials.  The callback's function form is:

     int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, const char* username,
     gnutls_datum_t *salt, gnutls_datum_t *verifier, gnutls_datum_t
     *generator, gnutls_datum_t *prime);

     `username' contains the actual username.  The  `salt' ,
     `verifier' ,  `generator' and  `prime' must be filled in using the
     `gnutls_malloc()' . For convenience  `prime' and  `generator' may
     also be one of the static parameters defined in gnutls.h.

     Initially, the data field is NULL in every `gnutls_datum_t'
     structure that the callback has to fill in. When the callback is
     done GnuTLS deallocates all of those buffers which are non-NULL,
     regardless of the return value.

     In order to prevent attackers from guessing valid usernames, if a
     user does not exist, g and n values should be filled in using a
     random user's parameters. In that case the callback must return
     the special value (1).  See `gnutls_srp_set_server_fake_salt_seed'
     too.  If this is not required for your application, return a
     negative number from the callback to abort the handshake.

     The callback function will only be called once per handshake.  The
     callback function should return 0 on success, while -1 indicates
     an error.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: PSK credentials,  Next: Anonymous credentials,  Prev: SRP credentials,  Up: Associating the credentials

6.4.3 PSK
---------

The initialization functions in PSK credentials differ between client
and server.

`INT *note gnutls_psk_allocate_server_credentials:: (gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t *            SC)'

`INT *note gnutls_psk_allocate_client_credentials:: (gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t *            SC)'

`VOID *note gnutls_psk_free_server_credentials:: (gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t SC)'

`VOID *note gnutls_psk_free_client_credentials:: (gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t SC)'

Clients supporting PSK should supply the username and key before a TLS
session is established.  Alternatively *note
gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials_function:: can be used to specify a
callback function. This has the advantage that the callback will be
called only if PSK has been negotiated.

`INT *note gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials:: (gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t RES, const char * USERNAME, const gnutls_datum_t * KEY, gnutls_psk_key_flags FLAGS)'

 -- Function: void gnutls_psk_set_client_credentials_function
          (gnutls_psk_client_credentials_t CRED,
          gnutls_psk_client_credentials_function * FUNC)
     CRED: is a `gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t'  structure.

     FUNC: is the callback function

     This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the
     username and password for client PSK authentication.  The
     callback's function form is: int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t,
     char** username, gnutls_datum_t* key);

     The  `username' and  `key' ->data must be allocated using
     `gnutls_malloc()' .   `username' should be ASCII strings or UTF-8
     strings prepared using the "SASLprep" profile of "stringprep".

     The callback function will be called once per handshake.

     The callback function should return 0 on success.  -1 indicates an
     error.

In server side the default behavior of GnuTLS is to read the usernames
and PSK keys from a password file. The password file should contain
usernames and keys in hexadecimal format. The name of the password file
can be stored to the credentials structure by calling *note
gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_file::.  If a different password file
format is to be used, then a callback should be set instead by *note
gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_function::.

The server can help the client chose a suitable username and password,
by sending a hint. Note that there is no common profile for the PSK
hint and applications are discouraged to use it.  A server, may specify
the hint by calling *note gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_hint::.
The client can retrieve the hint, for example in the callback function,
using *note gnutls_psk_client_get_hint::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_file
          (gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t RES, const char *
          PASSWORD_FILE)
     RES: is a `gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t'  structure.

     PASSWORD_FILE: is the PSK password file (passwd.psk)

     This function sets the password file, in a
     `gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t'  structure.  This password file
     holds usernames and keys and will be used for PSK authentication.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise an error code is returned.

`VOID *note gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_function:: (gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t         CRED, gnutls_psk_server_credentials_function         * FUNC)'

`INT *note gnutls_psk_set_server_credentials_hint:: (gnutls_psk_server_credentials_t RES, const char * HINT)'

`CONST CHAR * *note gnutls_psk_client_get_hint:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION)'

6.4.4 Anonymous
---------------

The key exchange methods for anonymous authentication might require
Diffie-Hellman parameters to be generated by the server and associated
with an anonymous credentials structure. Check *note Parameter
generation:: for more information.  The initialization functions for
the credentials are shown below.

`INT *note gnutls_anon_allocate_server_credentials:: (gnutls_anon_server_credentials_t *      SC)'

`INT *note gnutls_anon_allocate_client_credentials:: (gnutls_anon_client_credentials_t *      SC)'

`VOID *note gnutls_anon_free_server_credentials:: (gnutls_anon_server_credentials_t SC)'

`VOID *note gnutls_anon_free_client_credentials:: (gnutls_anon_client_credentials_t SC)'


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Setting up the transport layer,  Next: TLS handshake,  Prev: Associating the credentials,  Up: How to use GnuTLS in applications

6.5 Setting up the transport layer
==================================

The next step is to setup the underlying transport layer details. The
Berkeley sockets are implicitly used by GnuTLS, thus a call to *note
gnutls_transport_set_int:: would be sufficient to specify the socket
descriptor.

`VOID *note gnutls_transport_set_int:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, int I)'

`VOID *note gnutls_transport_set_int2:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, int RECV_INT, int SEND_INT)'

If however another transport layer than TCP is selected, then a pointer
should be used instead to express the parameter to be passed to custom
functions. In that case the following functions should be used instead.

`VOID *note gnutls_transport_set_ptr:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_transport_ptr_t PTR)'

`VOID *note gnutls_transport_set_ptr2:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_transport_ptr_t RECV_PTR, gnutls_transport_ptr_t SEND_PTR)'

Moreover all of the following push and pull callbacks should be set.

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_push_function (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, gnutls_push_func PUSH_FUNC)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     PUSH_FUNC: a callback function similar to `write()'

     This is the function where you set a push function for gnutls to
     use in order to send data.  If you are going to use berkeley style
     sockets, you do not need to use this function since the default
     send(2) will probably be ok.  Otherwise you should specify this
     function for gnutls to be able to send data.  The callback should
     return a positive number indicating the bytes sent, and -1 on
     error.

     `push_func' is of the form, ssize_t
     (*gnutls_push_func)(gnutls_transport_ptr_t, const void*, size_t);

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_vec_push_function
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_vec_push_func VEC_FUNC)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     VEC_FUNC: a callback function similar to `writev()'

     Using this function you can override the default writev(2)
     function for gnutls to send data. Setting this callback instead of
     `gnutls_transport_set_push_function()'  is recommended since it
     introduces less overhead in the TLS handshake process.

     `vec_func' is of the form, ssize_t (*gnutls_vec_push_func)
     (gnutls_transport_ptr_t, const giovec_t * iov, int iovcnt);

     *Since:* 2.12.0

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_pull_function (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, gnutls_pull_func PULL_FUNC)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     PULL_FUNC: a callback function similar to `read()'

     This is the function where you set a function for gnutls to receive
     data.  Normally, if you use berkeley style sockets, do not need to
     use this function since the default recv(2) will probably be ok.
     The callback should return 0 on connection termination, a positive
     number indicating the number of bytes received, and -1 on error.

     `gnutls_pull_func' is of the form, ssize_t
     (*gnutls_pull_func)(gnutls_transport_ptr_t, void*, size_t);

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_pull_timeout_func FUNC)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     FUNC: a callback function

     This is the function where you set a function for gnutls to know
     whether data are ready to be received. It should wait for data a
     given time frame in milliseconds. The callback should return 0 on
     timeout, a positive number if data can be received, and -1 on
     error.  You'll need to override this function if `select()'  is
     not suitable for the provided transport calls.

     As with `select()' , if the timeout value is zero the callback
     should return zero if no data are immediately available.

     `gnutls_pull_timeout_func' is of the form, int
     (*gnutls_pull_timeout_func)(gnutls_transport_ptr_t, unsigned int
     ms);

     *Since:* 3.0

The functions above accept a callback function which should return the
number of bytes written, or -1 on error and should set `errno'
appropriately.  In some environments, setting `errno' is unreliable.
For example Windows have several errno variables in different CRTs, or
in other systems it may be a non thread-local variable.  If this is a
concern to you, call *note gnutls_transport_set_errno:: with the
intended errno value instead of setting `errno' directly.

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_errno (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, int ERR)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     ERR: error value to store in session-specific errno variable.

     Store  `err' in the session-specific errno variable.  Useful values
     for  `err' is EAGAIN and EINTR, other values are treated will be
     treated as real errors in the push/pull function.

     This function is useful in replacement push and pull functions set
     by `gnutls_transport_set_push_function()'  and
     `gnutls_transport_set_pull_function()'  under Windows, where the
     replacements may not have access to the same  `errno' variable
     that is used by GnuTLS (e.g., the application is linked to
     msvcr71.dll and gnutls is linked to msvcrt.dll).

GnuTLS currently only interprets the EINTR, EAGAIN and EMSGSIZE errno
values and returns the corresponding GnuTLS error codes:
   * `GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED'

   * `GNUTLS_E_AGAIN'

   * `GNUTLS_E_LARGE_PACKET'
The EINTR and EAGAIN values are returned by interrupted system calls,
or when non blocking IO is used.  All GnuTLS functions can be resumed
(called again), if any of the above error codes is returned. The
EMSGSIZE value is returned when attempting to send a large datagram.

In the case of DTLS it is also desirable to override the generic
transport functions with functions that emulate the operation of
`recvfrom' and `sendto'. In addition DTLS requires timers during the
receive of a handshake message, set using the *note
gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function:: function. To check the
retransmission timers the function *note gnutls_dtls_get_timeout:: is
provided, which returns the time remaining until the next
retransmission, or better the time until *note gnutls_handshake::
should be called again.

 -- Function: void gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_pull_timeout_func FUNC)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     FUNC: a callback function

     This is the function where you set a function for gnutls to know
     whether data are ready to be received. It should wait for data a
     given time frame in milliseconds. The callback should return 0 on
     timeout, a positive number if data can be received, and -1 on
     error.  You'll need to override this function if `select()'  is
     not suitable for the provided transport calls.

     As with `select()' , if the timeout value is zero the callback
     should return zero if no data are immediately available.

     `gnutls_pull_timeout_func' is of the form, int
     (*gnutls_pull_timeout_func)(gnutls_transport_ptr_t, unsigned int
     ms);

     *Since:* 3.0

 -- Function: unsigned int gnutls_dtls_get_timeout (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     This function will return the milliseconds remaining for a
     retransmission of the previously sent handshake message. This
     function is useful when DTLS is used in non-blocking mode, to
     estimate when to call `gnutls_handshake()' if no packets have been
     received.

     *Returns:* the remaining time in milliseconds.

     *Since:* 3.0

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Asynchronous operation,  Next: DTLS sessions,  Up: Setting up the transport layer

6.5.1 Asynchronous operation
----------------------------

GnuTLS can be used with asynchronous socket or event-driven programming.
The approach is similar to using Berkeley sockets under such an
environment.  The blocking, due to network interaction, calls such as
*note gnutls_handshake::, *note gnutls_record_recv::, can be set to
non-blocking by setting the underlying sockets to non-blocking.  If
other push and pull functions are setup, then they should behave the
same way as `recv' and `send' when used in a non-blocking way, i.e.,
set errno to `EAGAIN'. Since, during a TLS protocol session GnuTLS does
not block except for network interaction, the non blocking `EAGAIN'
errno will be propagated and GnuTLS functions will return the
`GNUTLS_E_AGAIN' error code. Such calls can be resumed the same way as
a system call would.  The only exception is *note gnutls_record_send::,
which if interrupted subsequent calls need not to include the data to be
sent (can be called with NULL argument).

The `select' system call can also be used in combination with the
GnuTLS functions. `select' allows monitoring of sockets and notifies on
them being ready for reading or writing data. Note however that this
system call cannot notify on data present in GnuTLS read buffers, it is
only applicable to the kernel sockets API. Thus if you are using it for
reading from a GnuTLS session, make sure that any cached data are read
completely. That can be achieved by checking there are no data waiting
to be read (using *note gnutls_record_check_pending::), either before
the `select' system call, or after a call to *note
gnutls_record_recv::. GnuTLS does not keep a write buffer, thus when
writing no additional actions are required.

Although in the TLS protocol implementation each call to receive or send
function implies to restoring the same function that was interrupted, in
the DTLS protocol this requirement isn't true.  There are cases where a
retransmission is required, which are indicated by a received message
and thus *note gnutls_record_get_direction:: must be called to decide
which direction to check prior to restoring a function call.

 -- Function: int gnutls_record_get_direction (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     This function provides information about the internals of the
     record protocol and is only useful if a prior gnutls function call
     (e.g.  `gnutls_handshake()' ) was interrupted for some reason, that
     is, if a function returned `GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED'  or
     `GNUTLS_E_AGAIN' .  In such a case, you might want to call
     `select()' or `poll()'  before calling the interrupted gnutls
     function again.  To tell you whether a file descriptor should be
     selected for either reading or writing,
     `gnutls_record_get_direction()'  returns 0 if the interrupted
     function was trying to read data, and 1 if it was trying to write
     data.

     *Returns:* 0 if trying to read data, 1 if trying to write data.

Moreover, to prevent blocking from DTLS' retransmission timers to block
a handshake, the *note gnutls_init:: function should be called with the
`GNUTLS_NONBLOCK' flag set (see *note Session initialization::). In that
case, in order to be able to use the DTLS handshake timers, the function
*note gnutls_dtls_get_timeout:: should be used to estimate when to call
*note gnutls_handshake:: if no packets have been received.

6.5.2 DTLS sessions
-------------------

Because datagram TLS can operate over connections where the client
cannot be reliably verified, functionality in the form of cookies, is
available to prevent denial of service attacks to servers. GnuTLS
requires a server to generate a secret key that is used to sign a
cookie(1).  That cookie is sent to the client using *note
gnutls_dtls_cookie_send::, and the client must reply using the correct
cookie. The server side should verify the initial message sent by
client using *note gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify::.  If successful the
session should be initialized and associated with the cookie using
*note gnutls_dtls_prestate_set::, before proceeding to the handshake.

`INT *note gnutls_key_generate:: (gnutls_datum_t * KEY, unsigned int KEY_SIZE)'

`INT *note gnutls_dtls_cookie_send:: (gnutls_datum_t * KEY, void * CLIENT_DATA, size_t CLIENT_DATA_SIZE, gnutls_dtls_prestate_st * PRESTATE, gnutls_transport_ptr_t PTR, gnutls_push_func PUSH_FUNC)'

`INT *note gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify:: (gnutls_datum_t * KEY, void * CLIENT_DATA, size_t CLIENT_DATA_SIZE, void * _MSG, size_t MSG_SIZE, gnutls_dtls_prestate_st * PRESTATE)'

`VOID *note gnutls_dtls_prestate_set:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_dtls_prestate_st * PRESTATE)'

Note that the above apply to server side only and they are not
mandatory to be used. Not using them, however, allows denial of service
attacks.  The client side cookie handling is part of *note
gnutls_handshake::.

Datagrams are typically restricted by a maximum transfer unit (MTU).
For that both client and server side should set the correct maximum
transfer unit for the layer underneath GnuTLS. This will allow proper
fragmentation of DTLS messages and prevent messages from being silently
discarded by the transport layer. The "correct" maximum transfer unit
can be obtained through a path MTU discovery mechanism [_RFC4821_].

`VOID *note gnutls_dtls_set_mtu:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, unsigned int MTU)'

`UNSIGNED INT *note gnutls_dtls_get_mtu:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION)'

6.6 TLS handshake
=================

Once a session has been initialized and a network connection has been
set up, TLS and DTLS protocols perform a handshake. The handshake is
the actual key exchange.

 -- Function: int gnutls_handshake (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     This function does the handshake of the TLS/SSL protocol, and
     initializes the TLS connection.

     This function will fail if any problem is encountered, and will
     return a negative error code. In case of a client, if the client
     has asked to resume a session, but the server couldn't, then a
     full handshake will be performed.

     The non-fatal errors expected by this function are:
     `GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED' , `GNUTLS_E_AGAIN' , and
     `GNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED' .  The former two interrupt the
     handshake procedure due to the lower layer being interrupted, and
     the latter because of an alert that may be sent by a server (it is
     always a good idea to check any received alerts). On these errors
     call this function again, until it returns 0; cf.
     `gnutls_record_get_direction()'  and `gnutls_error_is_fatal()' .
     In DTLS sessions the non-fatal error `GNUTLS_E_LARGE_PACKET'  is
     also possible, and indicates that the MTU should be adjusted.

     If this function is called by a server after a rehandshake request
     then `GNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA'  or
     `GNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED'  may be returned.  Note that
     these are non fatal errors, only in the specific case of a
     rehandshake.  Their meaning is that the client rejected the
     rehandshake request or in the case of
     `GNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA'  it might also mean that some data
     were pending.

     *Returns:* `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  on success, otherwise a negative
     error code.

 -- Function: void gnutls_handshake_set_timeout (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, unsigned int MS)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     MS: is a timeout value in milliseconds

     This function sets the timeout for the handshake process to the
     provided value. Use an  `ms' value of zero to disable timeout, or
     `GNUTLS_DEFAULT_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT'  for a reasonable default value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

The handshake process doesn't ensure the verification of the peer's
identity. When certificates are in use, this can be done, either after
the handshake is complete, or during the handshake if *note
gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function:: has been used. In both cases
the *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2:: function can be used to
verify the peer's certificate (see *note Certificate authentication::
for more information).

`INT *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, unsigned int * STATUS)'


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Data transfer and termination,  Next: Buffered data transfer,  Prev: TLS handshake,  Up: How to use GnuTLS in applications

6.7 Data transfer and termination
=================================

Once the handshake is complete and peer's identity has been verified
data can be exchanged. The available functions resemble the POSIX
`recv' and `send' functions. It is suggested to use *note
gnutls_error_is_fatal:: to check whether the error codes returned by
these functions are fatal for the protocol or can be ignored.

 -- Function: ssize_t gnutls_record_send (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          const void * DATA, size_t DATA_SIZE)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     DATA: contains the data to send

     DATA_SIZE: is the length of the data

     This function has the similar semantics with `send()' .  The only
     difference is that it accepts a GnuTLS session, and uses different
     error codes.  Note that if the send buffer is full, `send()'  will
     block this function.  See the `send()'  documentation for more
     information.

     You can replace the default push function which is `send()' , by
     using `gnutls_transport_set_push_function()' .

     If the EINTR is returned by the internal push function then
     `GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED'  will be returned. If
     `GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED'  or `GNUTLS_E_AGAIN'  is returned, you must
     call this function again, with the exact same parameters;
     alternatively you could provide a `NULL'  pointer for data, and 0
     for size. cf. `gnutls_record_get_direction()' .

     Note that in DTLS this function will return the
     `GNUTLS_E_LARGE_PACKET' error code if the send data exceed the
     data MTU value - as returned by `gnutls_dtls_get_data_mtu()' . The
     errno value EMSGSIZE also maps to `GNUTLS_E_LARGE_PACKET' .  Note
     that since 3.2.13 this function can be called under cork in DTLS
     mode, and will refuse to send data over the MTU size by returning
     `GNUTLS_E_LARGE_PACKET' .

     *Returns:* The number of bytes sent, or a negative error code.  The
     number of bytes sent might be less than  `data_size' .  The maximum
     number of bytes this function can send in a single call depends on
     the negotiated maximum record size.

 -- Function: ssize_t gnutls_record_recv (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          void * DATA, size_t DATA_SIZE)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     DATA: the buffer that the data will be read into

     DATA_SIZE: the number of requested bytes

     This function has the similar semantics with `recv()' .  The only
     difference is that it accepts a GnuTLS session, and uses different
     error codes.  In the special case that a server requests a
     renegotiation, the client may receive an error code of
     `GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE' .  This message may be simply ignored,
     replied with an alert `GNUTLS_A_NO_RENEGOTIATION' , or replied
     with a new handshake, depending on the client's will.  If `EINTR'
     is returned by the internal push function (the default is `recv()'
     ) then `GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED'  will be returned.  If
     `GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED'  or `GNUTLS_E_AGAIN'  is returned, you must
     call this function again to get the data.  See also
     `gnutls_record_get_direction()' .  A server may also receive
     `GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE'  when a client has initiated a handshake.
     In that case the server can only initiate a handshake or terminate
     the connection.

     *Returns:* The number of bytes received and zero on EOF (for stream
     connections).  A negative error code is returned in case of an
     error.  The number of bytes received might be less than the
     requested  `data_size' .

 -- Function: int gnutls_error_is_fatal (int ERROR)
     ERROR: is a GnuTLS error code, a negative error code

     If a GnuTLS function returns a negative error code you may feed
     that value to this function to see if the error condition is fatal
     to a TLS session (i.e., must be terminated).

     Note that you may also want to check the error code manually,
     since some non-fatal errors to the protocol (such as a warning
     alert or a rehandshake request) may be fatal for your program.

     This function is only useful if you are dealing with errors from
     functions that relate to a TLS session (e.g., record layer or
     handshake layer handling functions).

     *Returns:* Non-zero value on fatal errors or zero on non-fatal.

Although, in the TLS protocol the receive function can be called at any
time, when DTLS is used the GnuTLS receive functions must be called
once a message is available for reading, even if no data are expected.
This is because in DTLS various (internal) actions may be required due
to retransmission timers. Moreover, an extended receive function is
shown below, which allows the extraction of the message's sequence
number. Due to the unreliable nature of the protocol, this field allows
distinguishing out-of-order messages.

 -- Function: ssize_t gnutls_record_recv_seq (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          void * DATA, size_t DATA_SIZE, unsigned char * SEQ)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     DATA: the buffer that the data will be read into

     DATA_SIZE: the number of requested bytes

     SEQ: is the packet's 64-bit sequence number. Should have space for
     8 bytes.

     This function is the same as `gnutls_record_recv()' , except that
     it returns in addition to data, the sequence number of the data.
     This is useful in DTLS where record packets might be received
     out-of-order. The returned 8-byte sequence number is an integer in
     big-endian format and should be treated as a unique message
     identification.

     *Returns:* The number of bytes received and zero on EOF.  A
     negative error code is returned in case of an error.  The number
     of bytes received might be less than  `data_size' .

     *Since:* 3.0

The *note gnutls_record_check_pending:: helper function is available to
allow checking whether data are available to be read in a GnuTLS session
buffers. Note that this function complements but does not replace
`select', i.e., *note gnutls_record_check_pending:: reports no data to
be read, `select' should be called to check for data in the network
buffers.

 -- Function: size_t gnutls_record_check_pending (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     This function checks if there are unread data in the gnutls
     buffers. If the return value is non-zero the next call to
     `gnutls_record_recv()' is guaranteed not to block.

     *Returns:* Returns the size of the data or zero.

`INT *note gnutls_record_get_direction:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION)'

Once a TLS or DTLS session is no longer needed, it is recommended to
use *note gnutls_bye:: to terminate the session. That way the peer is
notified securely about the intention of termination, which allows
distinguishing it from a malicious connection termination.  A session
can be deinitialized with the *note gnutls_deinit:: function.

 -- Function: int gnutls_bye (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          gnutls_close_request_t HOW)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     HOW: is an integer

     Terminates the current TLS/SSL connection. The connection should
     have been initiated using `gnutls_handshake()' .   `how' should be
     one of `GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR' , `GNUTLS_SHUT_WR' .

     In case of `GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR'  the TLS session gets terminated and
     further receives and sends will be disallowed.  If the return
     value is zero you may continue using the underlying transport
     layer. `GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR'  sends an alert containing a close
     request and waits for the peer to reply with the same message.

     In case of `GNUTLS_SHUT_WR'  the TLS session gets terminated and
     further sends will be disallowed. In order to reuse the connection
     you should wait for an EOF from the peer.  `GNUTLS_SHUT_WR'  sends
     an alert containing a close request.

     Note that not all implementations will properly terminate a TLS
     connection.  Some of them, usually for performance reasons, will
     terminate only the underlying transport layer, and thus not
     distinguishing between a malicious party prematurely terminating
     the connection and normal termination.

     This function may also return `GNUTLS_E_AGAIN'  or
     `GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED' ; cf.  `gnutls_record_get_direction()' .

     *Returns:* `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  on success, or an error code, see
     function documentation for entire semantics.

 -- Function: void gnutls_deinit (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     This function clears all buffers associated with the  `session' .
     This function will also remove session data from the session
     database if the session was terminated abnormally.

6.8 Buffered data transfer
==========================

Although *note gnutls_record_send:: is sufficient to transmit data to
the peer, when many small chunks of data are to be transmitted it is
inefficient and wastes bandwidth due to the TLS record overhead. In
that case it is preferrable to combine the small chunks before
transmission. The following functions provide that functionality.

 -- Function: void gnutls_record_cork (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     If called `gnutls_record_send()'  will no longer send partial
     records.  All queued records will be sent when `gnutls_uncork()'
     is called, or when the maximum record size is reached.

     This function is safe to use with DTLS after GnuTLS 3.3.0.

     *Since:* 3.1.9

 -- Function: int gnutls_record_uncork (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          unsigned int FLAGS)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     FLAGS: Could be zero or `GNUTLS_RECORD_WAIT'

     This resets the effect of `gnutls_cork()' , and flushes any pending
     data. If the `GNUTLS_RECORD_WAIT'  flag is specified then this
     function will block until the data is sent or a fatal error occurs
     (i.e., the function will retry on `GNUTLS_E_AGAIN'  and
     `GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED' ).

     If the flag `GNUTLS_RECORD_WAIT'  is not specified and the function
     is interrupted then the `GNUTLS_E_AGAIN'  or `GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED'
     errors will be returned. To obtain the data left in the corked
     buffer use `gnutls_record_check_corked()' .

     *Returns:* On success the number of transmitted data is returned,
     or otherwise a negative error code.

     *Since:* 3.1.9

6.9 Handling alerts
===================

During a TLS connection alert messages may be exchanged by the two
peers. Those messages may be fatal, meaning the connection must be
terminated afterwards, or warning when something needs to be reported
to the peer, but without interrupting the session.  The error codes
`GNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED' or `GNUTLS_E_FATAL_ALERT_RECEIVED'
signal those alerts when received, and may be returned by all GnuTLS
functions that receive data from the peer, being *note
gnutls_handshake:: and *note gnutls_record_recv::.

If those error codes are received the alert and its level should be
logged or reported to the peer using the functions below.

 -- Function: gnutls_alert_description_t gnutls_alert_get
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     This function will return the last alert number received.  This
     function should be called when `GNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED'
     or `GNUTLS_E_FATAL_ALERT_RECEIVED'  errors are returned by a gnutls
     function.  The peer may send alerts if he encounters an error.  If
     no alert has been received the returned value is undefined.

     *Returns:* the last alert received, a `gnutls_alert_description_t'
     value.

 -- Function: const char * gnutls_alert_get_name
          (gnutls_alert_description_t ALERT)
     ALERT: is an alert number.

     This function will return a string that describes the given alert
     number, or `NULL' .  See `gnutls_alert_get()' .

     *Returns:* string corresponding to `gnutls_alert_description_t'
     value.

The peer may also be warned or notified of a fatal issue by using one
of the functions below. All the available alerts are listed in *note
The Alert Protocol::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_alert_send (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          gnutls_alert_level_t LEVEL, gnutls_alert_description_t DESC)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     LEVEL: is the level of the alert

     DESC: is the alert description

     This function will send an alert to the peer in order to inform
     him of something important (eg. his Certificate could not be
     verified).  If the alert level is Fatal then the peer is expected
     to close the connection, otherwise he may ignore the alert and
     continue.

     The error code of the underlying record send function will be
     returned, so you may also receive `GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED'  or
     `GNUTLS_E_AGAIN'  as well.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise an error code is returned.

 -- Function: int gnutls_error_to_alert (int ERR, int * LEVEL)
     ERR: is a negative integer

     LEVEL: the alert level will be stored there

     Get an alert depending on the error code returned by a gnutls
     function.  All alerts sent by this function should be considered
     fatal.  The only exception is when  `err' is
     `GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE' , where a warning alert should be sent to
     the peer indicating that no renegotiation will be performed.

     If there is no mapping to a valid alert the alert to indicate
     internal error is returned.

     *Returns:* the alert code to use for a particular error code.

6.10 Priority strings
=====================

The GnuTLS priority strings specify the TLS session's handshake
algorithms and options in a compact, easy-to-use format.  That string
may contain a single initial keyword such as in *note
tab:prio-keywords:: and may be followed by additional algorithm or
special keywords. Note that their description is intentionally avoiding
specific algorithm details, as the priority strings are not constant
between gnutls versions (they are periodically updated to account for
cryptographic advances while providing compatibility with old clients
and servers).

`INT *note gnutls_priority_set_direct:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, const char * PRIORITIES, const char ** ERR_POS)'

`INT *note gnutls_priority_set:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_priority_t PRIORITY)'

Keyword        Description
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
@KEYWORD        Means that a compile-time specified system
               configuration file(1) will be used to expand the
               provided keyword. That is used to impose
               system-specific policies.  It may be followed by
               additional options that will be appended to the
               system string (e.g., "@SYSTEM:+SRP"). The system
               file should have the format 'KEYWORD=VALUE',
               e.g., 'SYSTEM=NORMAL:-ARCFOUR-128'.
PERFORMANCE     All the known to be secure ciphersuites are
               enabled, limited to 128 bit ciphers and sorted by
               terms of speed performance. The message
               authenticity security level is of 64 bits or more,
               and the certificate verification profile is set
               to GNUTLS_PROFILE_LOW (80-bits).
NORMAL          Means all the known to be secure ciphersuites.
               The ciphers are sorted by security margin,
               although the 256-bit ciphers are included as a
               fallback only.  The message authenticity security
               level is of 64 bits or more, and the certificate
               verification profile is set to GNUTLS_PROFILE_LOW
               (80-bits).
               
               This priority string implicitly enables ECDHE and
               DHE. The ECDHE ciphersuites are placed first in
               the priority order, but due to compatibility
               issues with the DHE ciphersuites they are placed
               last in the priority order, after the plain RSA
               ciphersuites.
LEGACY          This sets the NORMAL settings that were used for
               GnuTLS 3.2.x or earlier. There is no verification
               profile set, and the allowed DH primes are
               considered weak today (but are often used by
               misconfigured servers).
PFS             Means all the known to be secure ciphersuites
               that support perfect forward secrecy (ECDHE and
               DHE). The ciphers are sorted by security margin,
               although the 256-bit ciphers are included as a
               fallback only.  The message authenticity security
               level is of 80 bits or more, and the certificate
               verification profile is set to GNUTLS_PROFILE_LOW
               (80-bits).  This option is available since 3.2.4
               or later.
SECURE128       Means all known to be secure ciphersuites that
               offer a security level 128-bit or more.  The
               message authenticity security level is of 80 bits
               or more, and the certificate verification profile
               is set to GNUTLS_PROFILE_LOW (80-bits).
SECURE192       Means all the known to be secure ciphersuites
               that offer a security level 192-bit or more.  The
               message authenticity security level is of 128
               bits or more, and the certificate verification
               profile is set to GNUTLS_PROFILE_HIGH (128-bits).
SECURE256       Currently alias for SECURE192.
SUITEB128       Means all the NSA Suite B cryptography (RFC5430)
               ciphersuites with an 128 bit security level, as
               well as the enabling of the corresponding
               verification profile.
SUITEB192       Means all the NSA Suite B cryptography (RFC5430)
               ciphersuites with an 192 bit security level, as
               well as the enabling of the corresponding
               verification profile.
EXPORT          This priority string should be treated as
               deprecated.  GnuTLS no longer negotiates 40-bit
               ciphers.
NONE            Means nothing is enabled.  This disables even
               protocols and compression methods. It should be
               followed by the algorithms to be enabled.

Table 6.3: Supported initial keywords.

Unless the initial keyword is "NONE" the defaults (in preference order)
are for TLS protocols TLS 1.2, TLS1.1, TLS1.0, SSL3.0; for compression
NULL; for certificate types X.509.  In key exchange algorithms when in
NORMAL or SECURE levels the perfect forward secrecy algorithms take
precedence of the other protocols.  In all cases all the supported key
exchange algorithms are enabled.

Note that the SECURE levels distinguish between overall security level
and message authenticity security level. That is because the message
authenticity security level requires the adversary to break the
algorithms at real-time during the protocol run, whilst the overall
security level refers to off-line adversaries (e.g. adversaries
breaking the ciphertext years after it was captured).

The NONE keyword, if used, must followed by keywords specifying the
algorithms and protocols to be enabled. The other initial keywords do
not require, but may be followed by such keywords. All level keywords
can be combined, and for example a level of "SECURE256:+SECURE128" is
allowed.

The order with which every algorithm or protocol is specified is
significant. Algorithms specified before others will take precedence.
The supported algorithms and protocols are shown in *note
tab:prio-algorithms::.  To avoid collisions in order to specify a
compression algorithm in the priority string you have to prefix it with
"COMP-", protocol versions with "VERS-", signature algorithms with
"SIGN-" and certificate types with "CTYPE-".  All other algorithms
don't need a prefix. Each specified keyword can be prefixed with any of
the following characters.

'!' or '-'
     appended with an algorithm will remove this algorithm.

"+"
     appended with an algorithm will add this algorithm.

Note that the DHE key exchange methods are generally slower(2) than
their elliptic curves counterpart (ECDHE). Moreover the plain
Diffie-Hellman key exchange requires parameters to be generated and
associated with a credentials structure by the server (see *note

Keyword                          Description
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
%COMPAT                           will enable compatibility
                                 mode. It might mean that
                                 violations of the protocols are
                                 allowed as long as maximum
                                 compatibility with problematic
                                 clients and servers is
                                 achieved. More specifically this
                                 string would disable TLS record
                                 random padding, tolerate packets
                                 over the maximum allowed TLS
                                 record, and add a padding to
                                 TLS Client Hello packet to
                                 prevent it being in the 256-512
                                 range which is known to be
                                 causing issues with a commonly
                                 used firewall.
%DUMBFW                           will add a private extension
                                 with bogus data that make the
                                 client hello exceed 512 bytes.
                                 This avoids a black hole
                                 behavior in some firewalls.
                                 This is a non-standard TLS
                                 extension, use with care.
%NO_EXTENSIONS                    will prevent the sending of
                                 any TLS extensions in client
                                 side. Note that TLS 1.2
                                 requires extensions to be used,
                                 as well as safe renegotiation
                                 thus this option must be used
                                 with care.
%SERVER_PRECEDENCE                The ciphersuite will be
                                 selected according to server
                                 priorities and not the client's.
%SSL3_RECORD_VERSION              will use SSL3.0 record version
                                 in client hello.  This is the
                                 default.
%LATEST_RECORD_VERSION            will use the latest TLS
                                 version record version in
                                 client hello.

Keyword                          Description
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
%STATELESS_COMPRESSION            will disable keeping state
                                 across records when
                                 compressing. This may help to
                                 mitigate attacks when
                                 compression is used but an
                                 attacker is in control of input
                                 data. This has to be used only
                                 when the data that are possibly
                                 controlled by an attacker are
                                 placed in separate records.
%DISABLE_WILDCARDS                will disable matching
                                 wildcards when comparing
                                 hostnames in certificates.
%DISABLE_SAFE_RENEGOTIATION       will completely disable safe
                                 renegotiation completely.  Do
                                 not use unless you know what
                                 you are doing.
%UNSAFE_RENEGOTIATION             will allow handshakes and
                                 re-handshakes without the safe
                                 renegotiation extension.  Note
                                 that for clients this mode is
                                 insecure (you may be under
                                 attack), and for servers it
                                 will allow insecure clients to
                                 connect (which could be fooled
                                 by an attacker).  Do not use
                                 unless you know what you are
                                 doing and want maximum
                                 compatibility.
%PARTIAL_RENEGOTIATION            will allow initial handshakes
                                 to proceed, but not
                                 re-handshakes.  This leaves the
                                 client vulnerable to attack,
                                 and servers will be compatible
                                 with non-upgraded clients for
                                 initial handshakes.  This is
                                 currently the default for
                                 clients and servers, for
                                 compatibility reasons.
%SAFE_RENEGOTIATION               will enforce safe
                                 renegotiation.  Clients and
                                 servers will refuse to talk to
                                 an insecure peer.  Currently
                                 this causes interoperability
                                 problems, but is required for
                                 full protection.

                                 that an initial keyword that
                                 enables SUITEB automatically
                                 sets the profile.

Finally the ciphersuites enabled by any priority string can be listed
using the `gnutls-cli' application (see *note gnutls-cli Invocation::),
or by using the priority functions as in *note Listing the ciphersuites

Example priority strings are:
    The system imposed security level:
        "SYSTEM"

    The default priority without the HMAC-MD5:

        "NONE:+VERS-TLS-ALL:+MAC-ALL:+RSA:+AES-128-CBC:+SIGN-ALL:+COMP-NULL"

    Specifying the defaults except ARCFOUR-128:
        "NORMAL:-ARCFOUR-128"

    Enabling the 128-bit secure ciphers, while disabling SSL 3.0 and enabling compression:

faster, but also easier to break.  See *note Selecting cryptographic

6.11 Selecting cryptographic key sizes
======================================

Because many algorithms are involved in TLS, it is not easy to set a
consistent security level.  For this reason in *note tab:key-sizes:: we
present some correspondence between key sizes of symmetric algorithms
and public key algorithms based on [_ECRYPT_].  Those can be used to
generate certificates with appropriate key sizes as well as select
parameters for Diffie-Hellman and SRP authentication.

Table 6.7: Key sizes and security parameters.

The first column  provides a security parameter in a number of bits.
This gives an indication of the number of combinations to be tried by
an adversary to brute force a key. For example to test all possible
keys in a 112 bit security parameter 2^112 combinations have to be
tried. For today's technology this is infeasible.  The next two columns
correlate the security parameter with actual bit sizes of parameters
for DH, RSA, SRP and ECC algorithms.  A mapping to `gnutls_sec_param_t'
value is given for each security parameter, on the next column, and
finally a brief description of the level.

Note, however, that the values suggested here are nothing more than an
educated guess that is valid today. There are no guarantees that an
algorithm will remain unbreakable or that these values will remain
constant in time. There could be scientific breakthroughs that cannot
be predicted or total failure of the current public key systems by
quantum computers. On the other hand though the cryptosystems used in
TLS are selected in a conservative way and such catastrophic
breakthroughs or failures are believed to be unlikely.  The NIST
publication SP 800-57 [_NISTSP80057_] contains a similar table.

When using GnuTLS and a decision on bit sizes for a public key
algorithm is required, use of the following functions is recommended:

 -- Function: unsigned int gnutls_sec_param_to_pk_bits
          (gnutls_pk_algorithm_t ALGO, gnutls_sec_param_t PARAM)
     ALGO: is a public key algorithm

     PARAM: is a security parameter

     When generating private and public key pairs a difficult question
     is which size of "bits" the modulus will be in RSA and the group
     size in DSA. The easy answer is 1024, which is also wrong. This
     function will convert a human understandable security parameter to
     an appropriate size for the specific algorithm.

     *Returns:* The number of bits, or (0).

     *Since:* 2.12.0

 -- Function: gnutls_sec_param_t gnutls_pk_bits_to_sec_param
          (gnutls_pk_algorithm_t ALGO, unsigned int BITS)
     ALGO: is a public key algorithm

     BITS: is the number of bits

     This is the inverse of `gnutls_sec_param_to_pk_bits()' . Given an
     algorithm and the number of bits, it will return the security
     parameter. This is a rough indication.

     *Returns:* The security parameter.

     *Since:* 2.12.0

Those functions will convert a human understandable security parameter
of `gnutls_sec_param_t' type, to a number of bits suitable for a public
key algorithm.

`CONST CHAR * *note gnutls_sec_param_get_name:: (gnutls_sec_param_t PARAM)'

The following functions will set the minimum acceptable group size for
Diffie-Hellman and SRP authentication.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Session resumption,  Next: Certificate verification,  Up: Advanced topics

6.12.1 Session resumption
-------------------------

Client side
...........

To reduce time and roundtrips spent in a handshake the client can
request session resumption from a server that previously shared a
session with the client. For that the client has to retrieve and store
the session parameters. Before establishing a new session to the same
server the parameters must be re-associated with the GnuTLS session
using *note gnutls_session_set_data::.

`INT *note gnutls_session_get_data2:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_datum_t * DATA)'

`INT *note gnutls_session_get_id2:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_datum_t * SESSION_ID)'

`INT *note gnutls_session_set_data:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, const void * SESSION_DATA, size_t SESSION_DATA_SIZE)'

Keep in mind that sessions will be expired after some time, depending
on the server, and a server may choose not to resume a session even
when requested to.  The expiration is to prevent temporal session keys
from becoming long-term keys. Also note that as a client you must
enable, using the priority functions, at least the algorithms used in
the last session.

 -- Function: int gnutls_session_is_resumed (gnutls_session_t SESSION)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     Check whether session is resumed or not.

     *Returns:* non zero if this session is resumed, or a zero if this
     is a new session.

Server side
...........

In order to support resumption a server can store the session security
parameters in a local database or by using session tickets (see *note
Session tickets::) to delegate storage to the client. Because session
tickets might not be supported by all clients, servers could combine
the two methods.

A storing server needs to specify callback functions to store, retrieve
and delete session data. These can be registered with the functions
below. The stored sessions in the database can be checked using *note
gnutls_db_check_entry:: for expiration.

`VOID *note gnutls_db_set_retrieve_function:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_db_retr_func RETR_FUNC)'

`VOID *note gnutls_db_set_store_function:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_db_store_func STORE_FUNC)'

`VOID *note gnutls_db_set_ptr:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, void * PTR)'

`VOID *note gnutls_db_set_remove_function:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_db_remove_func REM_FUNC)'

`INT *note gnutls_db_check_entry:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_datum_t SESSION_ENTRY)'

A server utilizing tickets should generate ticket encryption and
authentication keys using *note gnutls_session_ticket_key_generate::.
Those keys should be associated with the GnuTLS session using *note
gnutls_session_ticket_enable_server::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_session_ticket_enable_server (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, const gnutls_datum_t * KEY)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     KEY: key to encrypt session parameters.

     Request that the server should attempt session resumption using
     SessionTicket.   `key' must be initialized with
     `gnutls_session_ticket_key_generate()' .

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned, or an
     error code.

     *Since:* 2.10.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_session_ticket_key_generate (gnutls_datum_t *
          KEY)
     KEY: is a pointer to a `gnutls_datum_t'  which will contain a newly
     created key.

     Generate a random key to encrypt security parameters within
     SessionTicket.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned, or an
     error code.

     *Since:* 2.10.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_session_resumption_requested (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION)
     SESSION: is a `gnutls_session_t'  structure.

     Check whether the client has asked for session resumption.  This
     function is valid only on server side.

     *Returns:* non zero if session resumption was asked, or a zero if
     not.

A server enabling both session tickets and a storage for session data
would use session tickets when clients support it and the storage
otherwise.

6.12.2 Certificate verification
-------------------------------

In this section the functionality for additional certificate
verification methods is listed.  These methods are intended to be used
in addition to normal PKI verification, in order to reduce the risk of
a compromised CA being undetected.

6.12.2.1 Trust on first use
...........................

The GnuTLS library includes functionlity to use an SSH-like trust on
first use authentication.  The available functions to store and verify
public keys are listed below.

 -- Function: int gnutls_verify_stored_pubkey (const char * DB_NAME,
          gnutls_tdb_t TDB, const char * HOST, const char * SERVICE,
          gnutls_certificate_type_t CERT_TYPE, const gnutls_datum_t *
          CERT, unsigned int FLAGS)
     DB_NAME: A file specifying the stored keys (use NULL for the
     default)

     TDB: A storage structure or NULL to use the default

     HOST: The peer's name

     SERVICE: non-NULL if this key is specific to a service (e.g. http)

     CERT_TYPE: The type of the certificate

     CERT: The raw (der) data of the certificate

     FLAGS: should be 0.

     This function will try to verify the provided (raw or DER-encoded)
     certificate using a list of stored public keys.  The  `service'
     field if non-NULL should be a port number.

     The  `retrieve' variable if non-null specifies a custom backend for
     the retrieval of entries. If it is NULL then the default file
     backend will be used. In POSIX-like systems the file backend uses
     the $HOME/.gnutls/known_hosts file.

     Note that if the custom storage backend is provided the retrieval
     function should return `GNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_KEY_MISMATCH' if the
     host/service pair is found but key doesn't match,
     `GNUTLS_E_NO_CERTIFICATE_FOUND'  if no such host/service with the
     given key is found, and 0 if it was found. The storage function
     should return 0 on success.

     *Returns:* If no associated public key is found then
     `GNUTLS_E_NO_CERTIFICATE_FOUND'  will be returned. If a key is
     found but does not match `GNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_KEY_MISMATCH' is
     returned. On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned, or a
     negative error value on other errors.

     *Since:* 3.0.13

 -- Function: int gnutls_store_pubkey (const char * DB_NAME,
          gnutls_tdb_t TDB, const char * HOST, const char * SERVICE,
          gnutls_certificate_type_t CERT_TYPE, const gnutls_datum_t *
          CERT, time_t EXPIRATION, unsigned int FLAGS)
     DB_NAME: A file specifying the stored keys (use NULL for the
     default)

     TDB: A storage structure or NULL to use the default

     HOST: The peer's name

     SERVICE: non-NULL if this key is specific to a service (e.g. http)

     CERT_TYPE: The type of the certificate

     CERT: The data of the certificate

     EXPIRATION: The expiration time (use 0 to disable expiration)

     FLAGS: should be 0.

     This function will store the provided (raw or DER-encoded)
     certificate to the list of stored public keys. The key will be
     considered valid until the provided expiration time.

     The  `store' variable if non-null specifies a custom backend for
     the storage of entries. If it is NULL then the default file
     backend will be used.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.0.13

In addition to the above the *note gnutls_store_commitment:: can be
used to implement a key-pinning architecture as in [_KEYPIN_].  This
provides a way for web server to commit on a public key that is not yet
active.

 -- Function: int gnutls_store_commitment (const char * DB_NAME,
          gnutls_tdb_t TDB, const char * HOST, const char * SERVICE,
          gnutls_digest_algorithm_t HASH_ALGO, const gnutls_datum_t *
          HASH, time_t EXPIRATION, unsigned int FLAGS)
     DB_NAME: A file specifying the stored keys (use NULL for the
     default)

     TDB: A storage structure or NULL to use the default

     HOST: The peer's name

     SERVICE: non-NULL if this key is specific to a service (e.g. http)

     HASH_ALGO: The hash algorithm type

     HASH: The raw hash

     EXPIRATION: The expiration time (use 0 to disable expiration)

     FLAGS: should be 0.

     This function will store the provided hash commitment to the list
     of stored public keys. The key with the given hash will be
     considered valid until the provided expiration time.

     The  `store' variable if non-null specifies a custom backend for
     the storage of entries. If it is NULL then the default file
     backend will be used.

     Note that this function is not thread safe with the default
     backend.

     *Returns:* On success, `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.0

The storage and verification functions may be used with the default
text file based back-end, or another back-end may be specified. That
should contain storage and retrieval functions and specified as below.

`INT *note gnutls_tdb_init:: (gnutls_tdb_t * TDB)'

`VOID *note gnutls_tdb_deinit:: (gnutls_tdb_t TDB)'

`VOID *note gnutls_tdb_set_verify_func:: (gnutls_tdb_t TDB, gnutls_tdb_verify_func VERIFY)'

`VOID *note gnutls_tdb_set_store_func:: (gnutls_tdb_t TDB, gnutls_tdb_store_func STORE)'

`VOID *note gnutls_tdb_set_store_commitment_func:: (gnutls_tdb_t TDB, gnutls_tdb_store_commitment_func        CSTORE)'

6.12.2.2 DANE verification
..........................

Since the DANE library is not included in GnuTLS it requires programs
to be linked against it. This can be achieved with the following
commands.

    gcc -o foo foo.c `pkg-config gnutls-dane --cflags --libs`

When a program uses the GNU autoconf system, then the following line or
similar can be used to detect the presence of the library.

    PKG_CHECK_MODULES([LIBDANE], [gnutls-dane >= 3.0.0])

    AC_SUBST([LIBDANE_CFLAGS])
    AC_SUBST([LIBDANE_LIBS])

The high level functionality provided by the DANE library is shown
below.

 -- Function: int dane_verify_crt (dane_state_t S, const gnutls_datum_t
          * CHAIN, unsigned CHAIN_SIZE, gnutls_certificate_type_t
          CHAIN_TYPE, const char * HOSTNAME, const char * PROTO,
          unsigned int PORT, unsigned int SFLAGS, unsigned int VFLAGS,
          unsigned int * VERIFY)
     S: A DANE state structure (may be NULL)

     CHAIN: A certificate chain

     CHAIN_SIZE: The size of the chain

     CHAIN_TYPE: The type of the certificate chain

     HOSTNAME: The hostname associated with the chain

     PROTO: The protocol of the service connecting (e.g. tcp)

     PORT: The port of the service connecting (e.g. 443)

     SFLAGS: Flags for the the initialization of  `s' (if NULL)

     VFLAGS: Verification flags; an OR'ed list of `dane_verify_flags_t'
     .

     VERIFY: An OR'ed list of `dane_verify_status_t' .

     This function will verify the given certificate chain against the
     CA constrains and/or the certificate available via DANE.  If no
     information via DANE can be obtained the flag
     `DANE_VERIFY_NO_DANE_INFO' is set. If a DNSSEC signature is not
     available for the DANE record then the verify flag
     `DANE_VERIFY_NO_DNSSEC_DATA'  is set.

     Note that the CA constraint only applies for the directly
     certifying CA and does not account for long CA chains. Moreover
     this function does not validate the provided chain.

     Due to the many possible options of DANE, there is no single threat
     model countered. When notifying the user about DANE verification
     results it may be better to mention: DANE verification did not
     reject the certificate, rather than mentioning a successful DANE
     verication.

     If the  `q' parameter is provided it will be used for caching
     entries.

     *Returns:* On success, `DANE_E_SUCCESS'  (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

`INT *note dane_verify_session_crt:: (dane_state_t S, gnutls_session_t SESSION, const char * HOSTNAME, const char * PROTO, unsigned int PORT, unsigned int SFLAGS, unsigned int VFLAGS, unsigned int * VERIFY)'

`CONST CHAR * *note dane_strerror:: (int ERROR)'

Note that the `dane_state_t' structure that is accepted by both
verification functions is optional. It is required when many queries
are performed to facilitate caching.  The following flags are returned
by the verify functions to indicate the status of the verification.

`DANE_VERIFY_CA_CONSTRAINTS_VIOLATED'
     The CA constraints were violated.

`DANE_VERIFY_CERT_DIFFERS'
     The certificate obtained via DNS differs.

`DANE_VERIFY_UNKNOWN_DANE_INFO'
     No known DANE data was found in the DNS record.

Figure 6.2: The DANE verification status flags.

In order to generate a DANE TLSA entry to use in a DNS server you may
use danetool (see *note danetool Invocation::).

6.12.3 Parameter generation
---------------------------

Several TLS ciphersuites require additional parameters that need to be
generated or provided by the application. The Diffie-Hellman based
ciphersuites (ANON-DH or DHE), require the group parameters to be
provided. Those can either be be generated on the fly using *note
gnutls_dh_params_generate2:: or imported from pregenerated data using
*note gnutls_dh_params_import_pkcs3::.  The parameters can be used in a
TLS session by calling *note gnutls_certificate_set_dh_params:: or
*note gnutls_anon_set_server_dh_params:: for anonymous sessions.

`INT *note gnutls_dh_params_generate2:: (gnutls_dh_params_t DPARAMS, unsigned int BITS)'

`INT *note gnutls_dh_params_import_pkcs3:: (gnutls_dh_params_t PARAMS, const gnutls_datum_t * PKCS3_PARAMS, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT)'

`VOID *note gnutls_certificate_set_dh_params:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, gnutls_dh_params_t DH_PARAMS)'

`VOID *note gnutls_anon_set_server_dh_params:: (gnutls_anon_server_credentials_t RES, gnutls_dh_params_t DH_PARAMS)'

Due to the time-consuming calculations required for the generation of
Diffie-Hellman parameters we suggest against performing generation of
them within an application. The `certtool' tool can be used to generate
or export known safe values that can be stored in code or in a
configuration file to provide the ability to replace. We also recommend
the usage of *note gnutls_sec_param_to_pk_bits:: (see *note Selecting
cryptographic key sizes::) to determine the bit size of the generated
parameters.

Note that the information stored in the generated PKCS #3 structure
changed with GnuTLS 3.0.9. Since that version the `privateValueLength'
member of the structure is set, allowing the server utilizing the
parameters to use keys of the size of the security parameter. This
provides better performance in key exchange.

To allow renewal of the parameters within an application without
accessing the credentials, which are a shared structure, an alternative
interface is available using a callback function.

 -- Function: void gnutls_certificate_set_params_function
          (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, gnutls_params_function
          * FUNC)
     RES: is a gnutls_certificate_credentials_t structure

     FUNC: is the function to be called

     This function will set a callback in order for the server to get
     the Diffie-Hellman or RSA parameters for certificate
     authentication.  The callback should return `GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'

6.12.4 Deriving keys for other applications/protocols
-----------------------------------------------------

In several cases, after a TLS connection is established, it is desirable
to derive keys to be used in another application or protocol (e.g., in
an other TLS session using pre-shared keys). The following describe
GnuTLS' implementation of RFC5705 to extract keys based on a session's
master secret.

The API to use is *note gnutls_prf::.  The function needs to be
provided with a label, and additional context data to mix in the
`extra' parameter.  Moreover, the API allows to switch the mix of the
client and server random nonces, using the `server_random_first'
parameter.  In typical uses you don't need it, so a zero value should
be provided in `server_random_first'.

For example, after establishing a TLS session using *note
gnutls_handshake::, you can obtain 32-bytes to be used as key, using
this call:

    #define MYLABEL "EXPORTER-My-protocol-name"
    #define MYCONTEXT "my-protocol's-1st-session"

    char out[32];
    rc = gnutls_prf (session, sizeof(MYLABEL)-1, MYLABEL, 0,
                     sizeof(MYCONTEXT)-1, MYCONTEXT, 32, out);

The output key depends on TLS' master secret, and is the same on both
client and server.

If you don't want to use the RFC5705 interface and not mix in the
client and server random nonces, there is a low-level TLS PRF interface
called *note gnutls_prf_raw::.

6.12.5 Channel bindings
-----------------------

In user authentication protocols (e.g., EAP or SASL mechanisms) it is
useful to have a unique string that identifies the secure channel that
is used, to bind together the user authentication with the secure
channel.  This can protect against man-in-the-middle attacks in some
situations.  That unique string is called a "channel binding".  For
background and discussion see [_RFC5056_].

In GnuTLS you can extract a channel binding using the *note
gnutls_session_channel_binding:: function.  Currently only the type
`GNUTLS_CB_TLS_UNIQUE' is supported, which corresponds to the
`tls-unique' channel binding for TLS defined in [_RFC5929_].

The following example describes how to print the channel binding data.
Note that it must be run after a successful TLS handshake.

    {
      gnutls_datum_t cb;
      int rc;

      rc = gnutls_session_channel_binding (session,
                                           GNUTLS_CB_TLS_UNIQUE,
                                           &cb);
      if (rc)
        fprintf (stderr, "Channel binding error: %s\n",
                 gnutls_strerror (rc));
      else
        {
          size_t i;
          printf ("- Channel binding 'tls-unique': ");
          for (i = 0; i < cb.size; i++)
            printf ("%02x", cb.data[i]);
          printf ("\n");
        }
    }

6.12.6 Interoperability
-----------------------

The TLS protocols support many ciphersuites, extensions and version
numbers. As a result, few implementations are not able to properly
interoperate once faced with extensions or version protocols they do
not support and understand. The TLS protocol allows for a graceful
downgrade to the commonly supported options, but practice shows it is
not always implemented correctly.

Because there is no way to achieve maximum interoperability with broken
peers without sacrificing security, GnuTLS ignores such peers by
default.  This might not be acceptable in cases where maximum
compatibility is required. Thus we allow enabling compatibility with
broken peers using priority strings (see *note Priority Strings::). A
conservative priority string that would disable certain TLS protocol
options that are known to cause compatibility problems, is shown below.
NORMAL:%COMPAT

For broken peers that do not tolerate TLS version numbers over TLS 1.0
another priority string is:
NORMAL:-VERS-TLS-ALL:+VERS-TLS1.0:+VERS-SSL3.0:%COMPAT
 This priority string will in addition to above, only enable SSL 3.0 and
TLS 1.0 as protocols.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Compatibility with the OpenSSL library,  Prev: Interoperability,  Up: Advanced topics

6.12.7 Compatibility with the OpenSSL library
---------------------------------------------

To ease GnuTLS' integration with existing applications, a compatibility
layer with the OpenSSL library is included in the `gnutls-openssl'
library. This compatibility layer is not complete and it is not
intended to completely re-implement the OpenSSL API with GnuTLS.  It
only provides limited source-level compatibility.

The prototypes for the compatibility functions are in the
`gnutls/openssl.h' header file. The limitations imposed by the
compatibility layer include:

   * Error handling is not thread safe.

7.1.3 Simple client example with anonymous authentication
---------------------------------------------------------

The simplest client using TLS is the one that doesn't do any
authentication.  This means no external certificates or passwords are
needed to set up the connection.  As could be expected, the connection
is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (active or redirection) attacks.
However, the data are integrity protected and encrypted from passive
eavesdroppers.

Note that due to the vulnerable nature of this method very few public
servers support it.

authentication. You can easily combine this functionality --that is
have a server that supports both X.509 and OpenPGP certificates-- but
we separated them to keep these examples as simple as possible.

8 Using GnuTLS as a cryptographic library
*****************************************

GnuTLS is not a low-level cryptographic library, i.e., it does not
provide access to basic cryptographic primitives. However it abstracts
the internal cryptographic back-end (see *note Cryptographic Backend::),
providing symmetric crypto, hash and HMAC algorithms, as well access to
the random number generation. For a low-level crypto API the usage of
nettle (1) library is recommended.

* Menu:

* Symmetric algorithms::
* Public key algorithms::
* Hash and HMAC functions::
* Random number generation::

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Symmetric algorithms,  Next: Public key algorithms,  Up: Using GnuTLS as a cryptographic library

8.1 Symmetric algorithms
========================

The available functions to access symmetric crypto algorithms operations
are shown below. The supported algorithms are the algorithms required
by the TLS protocol.  They are listed in *note Table 3.1: tab:ciphers.

`INT *note gnutls_cipher_init:: (gnutls_cipher_hd_t * HANDLE, gnutls_cipher_algorithm_t CIPHER, const gnutls_datum_t * KEY, const gnutls_datum_t * IV)'

`INT *note gnutls_cipher_encrypt2:: (gnutls_cipher_hd_t HANDLE, const void * TEXT, size_t TEXTLEN, void * CIPHERTEXT, size_t CIPHERTEXTLEN)'

`INT *note gnutls_cipher_decrypt2:: (gnutls_cipher_hd_t HANDLE, const void * CIPHERTEXT, size_t CIPHERTEXTLEN, void * TEXT, size_t TEXTLEN)'

`VOID *note gnutls_cipher_set_iv:: (gnutls_cipher_hd_t HANDLE, void * IV, size_t IVLEN)'

`VOID *note gnutls_cipher_deinit:: (gnutls_cipher_hd_t HANDLE)'

In order to support authenticated encryption with associated data
(AEAD) algorithms the following functions are provided to set the
associated data and retrieve the authentication tag.

`INT *note gnutls_cipher_add_auth:: (gnutls_cipher_hd_t HANDLE, const void * TEXT, size_t TEXT_SIZE)'

`INT *note gnutls_cipher_tag:: (gnutls_cipher_hd_t HANDLE, void * TAG, size_t TAG_SIZE)'

8.2 Public key algorithms
=========================

Public key cryptography algorithms such as RSA, DSA and ECDSA, can be
accessed using the abstract key API in *note Abstract key types::. This
is a high level API with the advantage of transparently handling keys
in memory and keys present in smart cards.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Hash and HMAC functions,  Next: Random number generation,  Prev: Public key algorithms,  Up: Using GnuTLS as a cryptographic library

8.3 Hash and HMAC functions
===========================

The available operations to access hash functions and hash-MAC (HMAC)
algorithms are shown below. HMAC algorithms provided keyed hash
functionality. They supported HMAC algorithms are listed in *note Table
3.2: tab:macs.

`INT *note gnutls_hmac_init:: (gnutls_hmac_hd_t * DIG, gnutls_mac_algorithm_t ALGORITHM, const void * KEY, size_t KEYLEN)'

`INT *note gnutls_hmac:: (gnutls_hmac_hd_t HANDLE, const void * TEXT, size_t TEXTLEN)'

`VOID *note gnutls_hmac_output:: (gnutls_hmac_hd_t HANDLE, void * DIGEST)'

`VOID *note gnutls_hmac_deinit:: (gnutls_hmac_hd_t HANDLE, void * DIGEST)'

`INT *note gnutls_hmac_fast:: (gnutls_mac_algorithm_t ALGORITHM, const void * KEY, size_t KEYLEN, const void * TEXT, size_t TEXTLEN, void * DIGEST)'

The available functions to access hash functions are shown below. The
supported hash functions are the same as the HMAC algorithms.

`INT *note gnutls_hash_init:: (gnutls_hash_hd_t * DIG, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t ALGORITHM)'

8.4 Random number generation
============================

Access to the random number generator is provided using the *note
gnutls_rnd:: function. It allows obtaining random data of various
levels.

`GNUTLS_RND_NONCE'
     Non-predictable random number.  Fatal in parts of session if
     broken, i.e., vulnerable to statistical analysis.

`GNUTLS_RND_RANDOM'
     Pseudo-random cryptographic random number.  Fatal in session if
     broken.

`GNUTLS_RND_KEY'
     Fatal in many sessions if broken.

Figure 8.1: The random number levels.

 -- Function: int gnutls_rnd (gnutls_rnd_level_t LEVEL, void * DATA,
          size_t LEN)
     LEVEL: a security level

     DATA: place to store random bytes

     LEN: The requested size

     This function will generate random data and store it to output
     buffer.

     *Returns:* Zero or a negative error code on error.

     *Since:* 2.12.0

9.1 Invoking gnutls-cli
=======================

Simple client program to set up a TLS connection to some other computer.
It sets up a TLS connection and forwards data from the standard input
to the secured socket and vice versa.

This section was generated by *AutoGen*, using the `agtexi-cmd'
template and the option descriptions for the `gnutls-cli' program.
This software is released under the GNU General Public License, version
3 or later.

gnutls-cli help/usage (`--help')
--------------------------------

This is the automatically generated usage text for gnutls-cli.

The text printed is the same whether selected with the `help' option
(`--help') or the `more-help' option (`--more-help').  `more-help' will
print the usage text by passing it through a pager program.
`more-help' is disabled on platforms without a working `fork(2)'
function.  The `PAGER' environment variable is used to select the
program, defaulting to `more'.  Both will exit with a status code of 0.

Simple client program to set up a TLS connection to some other computer.  It
sets up a TLS connection and forwards data from the standard input to the
secured socket and vice versa.

debug option (-d)
-----------------

This is the "enable debugging" option.  This option takes a number
argument.  Specifies the debug level.

tofu option
-----------

This is the "enable trust on first use authentication" option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * can be disabled with -no-tofu.

This option will, in addition to certificate authentication, perform
authentication based on previously seen public keys, a model similar to
SSH authentication. Note that when tofu is specified (PKI) and DANE
authentication will become advisory to assist the public key acceptance
process.

strict-tofu option
------------------

This is the "fail to connect if a known certificate has changed" option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * can be disabled with -no-strict-tofu.

This option will perform authentication as with option -tofu; however,
while -tofu asks whether to trust a changed public key, this option
will fail in case of public key changes.

dane option
-----------

This is the "enable dane certificate verification (dnssec)" option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * can be disabled with -no-dane.

This option will, in addition to certificate authentication using the
trusted CAs, verify the server certificates using on the DANE
information available via DNSSEC.

local-dns option
----------------

This is the "use the local dns server for dnssec resolving" option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * can be disabled with -no-local-dns.

This option will use the local DNS server for DNSSEC.  This is disabled
by default due to many servers not allowing DNSSEC.

ca-verification option
----------------------

This is the "disable ca certificate verification" option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * can be disabled with -no-ca-verification.

   * It is enabled by default.

This option will disable CA certificate verification. It is to be used
with the -dane or -tofu options.

ocsp option
-----------

This is the "enable ocsp certificate verification" option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * can be disabled with -no-ocsp.

This option will enable verification of the peer's certificate using
ocsp

resume option (-r)
------------------

This is the "establish a session and resume" option.  Connect,
establish a session, reconnect and resume.

rehandshake option (-e)
-----------------------

This is the "establish a session and rehandshake" option.  Connect,
establish a session and rehandshake immediately.

starttls option (-s)
--------------------

This is the "connect, establish a plain session and start tls" option.
The TLS session will be initiated when EOF or a SIGALRM is received.

dh-bits option
--------------

This is the "the minimum number of bits allowed for dh" option.  This
option takes a number argument.  This option sets the minimum number of
bits allowed for a Diffie-Hellman key exchange. You may want to lower
the default value if the peer sends a weak prime and you get an
connection error with unacceptable prime.

priority option
---------------

This is the "priorities string" option.  This option takes a string
argument.  TLS algorithms and protocols to enable. You can use
predefined sets of ciphersuites such as PERFORMANCE, NORMAL, PFS,
SECURE128, SECURE256. The default is NORMAL.

Check  the  GnuTLS  manual  on  section  "Priority strings" for more
information on the allowed keywords

ranges option
-------------

This is the "use length-hiding padding to prevent traffic analysis"
option.  When possible (e.g., when using CBC ciphersuites), use
length-hiding padding to prevent traffic analysis.

list option (-l)
----------------

This is the "print a list of the supported algorithms and modes" option.
Print a list of the supported algorithms and modes. If a priority
string is given then only the enabled ciphersuites are shown.

alpn option
-----------

This is the "application layer protocol" option.  This option takes a
string argument.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * may appear an unlimited number of times.

This option will set and enable the Application Layer Protocol
Negotiation  (ALPN) in the TLS protocol.

disable-extensions option
-------------------------

This is the "disable all the tls extensions" option.  This option
disables all TLS extensions. Deprecated option. Use the priority string.

inline-commands option
----------------------

This is the "inline commands of the form ^<cmd>^" option.  Enable
inline commands of the form ^<cmd>^. The inline commands are expected
to be in a line by themselves. The available commands are: resume and
renegotiate.

inline-commands-prefix option
-----------------------------

This is the "change the default (^) used as a delimiter for inline
commands.  				the value is a single us-ascii
character (octets 0 - 127)." option.  This option takes a string
argument.  Change the default (^) delimiter used for inline commands.
The delimiter is expected to be a single US-ASCII character (octets 0 -
127). This option is only relevant if inline commands are enabled via
the inline-commands option

provider option
---------------

This is the "specify the pkcs #11 provider library" option.  This
option takes a file argument.  This will override the default options
in /etc/gnutls/pkcs11.conf

gnutls-cli exit status
----------------------

One of the following exit values will be returned:
`0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)'
     Successful program execution.

`1 (EXIT_FAILURE)'
     The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.

gnutls-cli Examples
-------------------

Connecting using PSK authentication
-----------------------------------

To connect to a server using PSK authentication, you need to enable the
choice of PSK by using a cipher priority parameter such as in the
example below.
    $ ./gnutls-cli -p 5556 localhost --pskusername psk_identity \
        --pskkey 88f3824b3e5659f52d00e959bacab954b6540344 \
        --priority NORMAL:-KX-ALL:+ECDHE-PSK:+DHE-PSK:+PSK
    Resolving 'localhost'...
    Connecting to '127.0.0.1:5556'...
    - PSK authentication.
    - Version: TLS1.1
    - Key Exchange: PSK
    - Cipher: AES-128-CBC
    - MAC: SHA1
    - Compression: NULL
    - Handshake was completed

    - Simple Client Mode:
By keeping the -pskusername parameter and removing the -pskkey
parameter, it will query only for the password during the handshake.

Listing ciphersuites in a priority string
-----------------------------------------

To list the ciphersuites in a priority string:
    $ ./gnutls-cli --priority SECURE192 -l
    Cipher suites for SECURE192
    TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_AES_256_CBC_SHA384         0xc0, 0x24	TLS1.2
    TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_AES_256_GCM_SHA384         0xc0, 0x2e	TLS1.2
    TLS_ECDHE_RSA_AES_256_GCM_SHA384           0xc0, 0x30	TLS1.2
    TLS_DHE_RSA_AES_256_CBC_SHA256             0x00, 0x6b	TLS1.2
    TLS_DHE_DSS_AES_256_CBC_SHA256             0x00, 0x6a	TLS1.2
    TLS_RSA_AES_256_CBC_SHA256                 0x00, 0x3d	TLS1.2

    Certificate types: CTYPE-X.509
    Protocols: VERS-TLS1.2, VERS-TLS1.1, VERS-TLS1.0, VERS-SSL3.0, VERS-DTLS1.0
    Compression: COMP-NULL
    Elliptic curves: CURVE-SECP384R1, CURVE-SECP521R1
    PK-signatures: SIGN-RSA-SHA384, SIGN-ECDSA-SHA384, SIGN-RSA-SHA512, SIGN-ECDSA-SHA512

Connecting using a PKCS #11 token
---------------------------------

To connect to a server using a certificate and a private key present in
a PKCS #11 token you need to substitute the PKCS 11 URLs in the
x509certfile and x509keyfile parameters.

Those can be found using "p11tool -list-tokens" and then listing all
the objects in the needed token, and using the appropriate.
    $ p11tool --list-tokens

    Token 0:
    URL: pkcs11:model=PKCS15;manufacturer=MyMan;serial=1234;token=Test
    Label: Test
    Manufacturer: EnterSafe
    Model: PKCS15
    Serial: 1234

    $ p11tool --login --list-certs "pkcs11:model=PKCS15;manufacturer=MyMan;serial=1234;token=Test"

    Object 0:
    URL: pkcs11:model=PKCS15;manufacturer=MyMan;serial=1234;token=Test;object=client;object-type=cert
    Type: X.509 Certificate
    Label: client
    ID: 2a:97:0d:58:d1:51:3c:23:07:ae:4e:0d:72:26:03:7d:99:06:02:6a

    $ export MYCERT="pkcs11:model=PKCS15;manufacturer=MyMan;serial=1234;token=Test;object=client;object-type=cert"
    $ export MYKEY="pkcs11:model=PKCS15;manufacturer=MyMan;serial=1234;token=Test;object=client;object-type=private"

    $ gnutls-cli www.example.com --x509keyfile $MYKEY --x509certfile MYCERT
Notice that the private key only differs from the certificate in the
object-type.

One of the following exit values will be returned:
`0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)'
     Successful program execution.

`1 (EXIT_FAILURE)'
     The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.

gnutls-serv See Also
--------------------

gnutls-cli-debug(1), gnutls-cli(1)

gnutls-serv Examples
--------------------

Running your own TLS server based on GnuTLS can be useful when
debugging clients and/or GnuTLS itself.  This section describes how to
use `gnutls-serv' as a simple HTTPS server.

The most basic server can be started as:

    gnutls-serv --http --priority "NORMAL:+ANON-ECDH:+ANON-DH"

It will only support anonymous ciphersuites, which many TLS clients
refuse to use.

The next step is to add support for X.509.  First we generate a CA:

    $ certtool --generate-privkey > x509-ca-key.pem
    $ echo 'cn = GnuTLS test CA' > ca.tmpl
    $ echo 'ca' >> ca.tmpl
    $ echo 'cert_signing_key' >> ca.tmpl
    $ certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey x509-ca-key.pem \
      --template ca.tmpl --outfile x509-ca.pem
    ...

Then generate a server certificate.  Remember to change the dns_name
value to the name of your server host, or skip that command to avoid
the field.

    $ certtool --generate-privkey > x509-server-key.pem
    $ echo 'organization = GnuTLS test server' > server.tmpl
    $ echo 'cn = test.gnutls.org' >> server.tmpl
    $ echo 'tls_www_server' >> server.tmpl
    $ echo 'encryption_key' >> server.tmpl
    $ echo 'signing_key' >> server.tmpl
    $ echo 'dns_name = test.gnutls.org' >> server.tmpl
    $ certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey x509-server-key.pem \
      --load-ca-certificate x509-ca.pem --load-ca-privkey x509-ca-key.pem \
      --template server.tmpl --outfile x509-server.pem
    ...

For use in the client, you may want to generate a client certificate as
well.

    $ certtool --generate-privkey > x509-client-key.pem
    $ echo 'cn = GnuTLS test client' > client.tmpl
    $ echo 'tls_www_client' >> client.tmpl
    $ echo 'encryption_key' >> client.tmpl
    $ echo 'signing_key' >> client.tmpl
    $ certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey x509-client-key.pem \
      --load-ca-certificate x509-ca.pem --load-ca-privkey x509-ca-key.pem \
      --template client.tmpl --outfile x509-client.pem
    ...

To be able to import the client key/certificate into some applications,
you will need to convert them into a PKCS#12 structure.  This also
encrypts the security sensitive key with a password.

    $ certtool --to-p12 --load-ca-certificate x509-ca.pem \
      --load-privkey x509-client-key.pem --load-certificate x509-client.pem \
      --outder --outfile x509-client.p12

For icing, we'll create a proxy certificate for the client too.

    $ certtool --generate-privkey > x509-proxy-key.pem
    $ echo 'cn = GnuTLS test client proxy' > proxy.tmpl
    $ certtool --generate-proxy --load-privkey x509-proxy-key.pem \
      --load-ca-certificate x509-client.pem --load-ca-privkey x509-client-key.pem \
      --load-certificate x509-client.pem --template proxy.tmpl \
      --outfile x509-proxy.pem
    ...

Then start the server again:

    $ gnutls-serv --http \
                --x509cafile x509-ca.pem \
                --x509keyfile x509-server-key.pem \
                --x509certfile x509-server.pem

Try connecting to the server using your web browser.  Note that the
server listens to port 5556 by default.

While you are at it, to allow connections using DSA, you can also
create a DSA key and certificate for the server.  These credentials
will be used in the final example below.

    $ certtool --generate-privkey --dsa > x509-server-key-dsa.pem
    $ certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey x509-server-key-dsa.pem \
      --load-ca-certificate x509-ca.pem --load-ca-privkey x509-ca-key.pem \
      --template server.tmpl --outfile x509-server-dsa.pem
    ...

The next step is to create OpenPGP credentials for the server.

    gpg --gen-key
    ...enter whatever details you want, use 'test.gnutls.org' as name...

Make a note of the OpenPGP key identifier of the newly generated key,
here it was `5D1D14D8'.  You will need to export the key for GnuTLS to
be able to use it.

    gpg -a --export 5D1D14D8 > openpgp-server.txt
    gpg --export 5D1D14D8 > openpgp-server.bin
    gpg --export-secret-keys 5D1D14D8 > openpgp-server-key.bin
    gpg -a --export-secret-keys 5D1D14D8 > openpgp-server-key.txt

Let's start the server with support for OpenPGP credentials:

    gnutls-serv --http --priority NORMAL:+CTYPE-OPENPGP \
                --pgpkeyfile openpgp-server-key.txt \
                --pgpcertfile openpgp-server.txt

The next step is to add support for SRP authentication. This requires
an SRP password file created with `srptool'.  To start the server with
SRP support:

    gnutls-serv --http --priority NORMAL:+SRP-RSA:+SRP \
                --srppasswdconf srp-tpasswd.conf \
                --srppasswd srp-passwd.txt

Let's also start a server with support for PSK. This would require a
password file created with `psktool'.

    gnutls-serv --http --priority NORMAL:+ECDHE-PSK:+PSK \
                --pskpasswd psk-passwd.txt

Finally, we start the server with all the earlier parameters and you
get this command:

    gnutls-serv --http --priority NORMAL:+PSK:+SRP:+CTYPE-OPENPGP \
                --x509cafile x509-ca.pem \
                --x509keyfile x509-server-key.pem \
                --x509certfile x509-server.pem \
                --x509dsakeyfile x509-server-key-dsa.pem \
                --x509dsacertfile x509-server-dsa.pem \
                --pgpkeyfile openpgp-server-key.txt \
                --pgpcertfile openpgp-server.txt \
                --srppasswdconf srp-tpasswd.conf \
                --srppasswd srp-passwd.txt \
                --pskpasswd psk-passwd.txt

10 Internal Architecture of GnuTLS
**********************************

This chapter is to give a brief description of the way GnuTLS works.
The focus is to give an idea to potential developers and those who want
to know what happens inside the black box.

* Menu:

* The TLS Protocol::
* TLS Handshake Protocol::
* TLS Authentication Methods::
* TLS Extension Handling::
* Cryptographic Backend::


File: gnutls.info,  Node: The TLS Protocol,  Next: TLS Handshake Protocol,  Up: Internal architecture of GnuTLS

10.1 The TLS Protocol
=====================

The main use case for the TLS protocol is shown in *note
fig-client-server::.  A user of a library implementing the protocol
expects no less than this functionality, i.e., to be able to set
parameters such as the accepted security level, perform a negotiation
with the peer and be able to exchange data.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: TLS Handshake Protocol,  Next: TLS Authentication Methods,  Prev: The TLS Protocol,  Up: Internal architecture of GnuTLS

10.2 TLS Handshake Protocol
===========================

The GnuTLS handshake protocol is implemented as a state machine that
waits for input or returns immediately when the non-blocking transport
layer functions are used. The main idea is shown in *note
fig-gnutls-handshake::.

 [image src="gnutls-handshake-state.png" ]

Figure 10.2: GnuTLS handshake state machine.

Also the way the input is processed varies per ciphersuite. Several
implementations of the internal handlers are available and *note
gnutls_handshake:: only multiplexes the input to the appropriate
handler. For example a PSK ciphersuite has a different implementation
of the `process_client_key_exchange' than a certificate ciphersuite. We
illustrate the idea in *note fig-gnutls-handshake-sequence::.

10.3 TLS Authentication Methods
===============================

In GnuTLS authentication methods can be implemented quite easily.
Since the required changes to add a new authentication method affect
only the handshake protocol, a simple interface is used. An
authentication method needs to implement the functions shown below.

typedef struct
{
  const char *name;
  int (*gnutls_generate_server_certificate) (gnutls_session_t, gnutls_buffer_st*);
  int (*gnutls_generate_client_certificate) (gnutls_session_t, gnutls_buffer_st*);
  int (*gnutls_generate_server_kx) (gnutls_session_t, gnutls_buffer_st*);
  int (*gnutls_generate_client_kx) (gnutls_session_t, gnutls_buffer_st*);
  int (*gnutls_generate_client_cert_vrfy) (gnutls_session_t, gnutls_buffer_st *);
  int (*gnutls_generate_server_certificate_request) (gnutls_session_t,
                                                     gnutls_buffer_st *);

  int (*gnutls_process_server_certificate) (gnutls_session_t, opaque *,
                                            size_t);
  int (*gnutls_process_client_certificate) (gnutls_session_t, opaque *,
                                            size_t);
  int (*gnutls_process_server_kx) (gnutls_session_t, opaque *, size_t);
  int (*gnutls_process_client_kx) (gnutls_session_t, opaque *, size_t);
  int (*gnutls_process_client_cert_vrfy) (gnutls_session_t, opaque *, size_t);
  int (*gnutls_process_server_certificate_request) (gnutls_session_t,
                                                    opaque *, size_t);
} mod_auth_st;

Those functions are responsible for the interpretation of the handshake
protocol messages. It is common for such functions to read data from
one or more `credentials_t' structures(1) and write data, such as
certificates, usernames etc. to `auth_info_t' structures.

Simple examples of existing authentication methods can be seen in
`auth/psk.c' for PSK ciphersuites and `auth/srp.c' for SRP
ciphersuites. After implementing these functions the structure holding
its pointers has to be registered in `gnutls_algorithms.c' in the
`_gnutls_kx_algorithms' structure.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: TLS Extension Handling,  Next: Cryptographic Backend,  Prev: TLS Authentication Methods,  Up: Internal architecture of GnuTLS

10.4 TLS Extension Handling
===========================

As with authentication methods, the TLS extensions handlers can be
implemented using the interface shown below.

typedef int (*gnutls_ext_recv_func) (gnutls_session_t session,
                                     const unsigned char *data, size_t len);
typedef int (*gnutls_ext_send_func) (gnutls_session_t session,
                                     gnutls_buffer_st *extdata);

Here there are two functions, one for receiving the extension data and
one for sending. These functions have to check internally whether they
operate in client or server side.

A simple example of an extension handler can be seen in `ext/srp.c' in
GnuTLS' source code. After implementing these functions, together with
the extension number they handle, they have to be registered using
`_gnutls_ext_register' in `gnutls_extensions.c' typically within
`_gnutls_ext_init'.

Adding a new TLS extension
--------------------------

Adding support for a new TLS extension is done from time to time, and
the process to do so is not difficult.  Here are the steps you need to
follow if you wish to do this yourself.  For sake of discussion, let's
consider adding support for the hypothetical TLS extension `foobar'.

Add `configure' option like `--enable-foobar' or `--disable-foobar'.
....................................................................

This step is useful when the extension code is large and it might be
desirable to disable the extension under some circumstances. Otherwise
it can be safely skipped.

Whether to chose enable or disable depends on whether you intend to
make the extension be enabled by default.  Look at existing checks
(i.e., SRP, authz) for how to model the code.  For example:

    AC_MSG_CHECKING([whether to disable foobar support])
    AC_ARG_ENABLE(foobar,
    	AS_HELP_STRING([--disable-foobar],
    		[disable foobar support]),
    	ac_enable_foobar=no)
    if test x$ac_enable_foobar != xno; then
     AC_MSG_RESULT(no)
     AC_DEFINE(ENABLE_FOOBAR, 1, [enable foobar])
    else
     ac_full=0
     AC_MSG_RESULT(yes)
    fi
    AM_CONDITIONAL(ENABLE_FOOBAR, test "$ac_enable_foobar" != "no")

These lines should go in `m4/hooks.m4'.

Add IANA extension value to `extensions_t' in `gnutls_int.h'.
.............................................................

A good name for the value would be GNUTLS_EXTENSION_FOOBAR.  Check with
`http://www.iana.org/assignments/tls-extensiontype-values' for
allocated values.  For experiments, you could pick a number but
remember that some consider it a bad idea to deploy such modified
version since it will lead to interoperability problems in the future
when the IANA allocates that number to someone else, or when the foobar
protocol is allocated another number.

Add an entry to `_gnutls_extensions' in `gnutls_extensions.c'.
..............................................................

A typical entry would be:

      int ret;

    #if ENABLE_FOOBAR
      ret = _gnutls_ext_register (&foobar_ext);
      if (ret != GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS)
        return ret;
    #endif

Most likely you'll need to add an `#include "ext/foobar.h"', that will
contain something like like:
      extension_entry_st foobar_ext = {
        .name = "FOOBAR",
        .type = GNUTLS_EXTENSION_FOOBAR,
        .parse_type = GNUTLS_EXT_TLS,
        .recv_func = _foobar_recv_params,
        .send_func = _foobar_send_params,
        .pack_func = _foobar_pack,
        .unpack_func = _foobar_unpack,
        .deinit_func = NULL
      }

The GNUTLS_EXTENSION_FOOBAR is the integer value you added to
`gnutls_int.h' earlier.  In this structure you specify the functions to
read the extension from the hello message, the function to send the
reply to, and two more functions to pack and unpack from stored session
data (e.g. when resumming a session). The `deinit' function will be
called to deinitialize the extension's private parameters, if any.

Note that the conditional `ENABLE_FOOBAR' definition should only be
used if step 1 with the `configure' options has taken place.

Add new files that implement the extension.
...........................................

The functions you are responsible to add are those mentioned in the
previous step.  They should be added in a file such as `ext/foobar.c'
and headers should be placed in `ext/foobar.h'.  As a starter, you
could add this:

    int
    _foobar_recv_params (gnutls_session_t session, const opaque * data,
                         size_t data_size)
    {
      return 0;
    }

    int
    _foobar_send_params (gnutls_session_t session, gnutls_buffer_st* data)
    {
      return 0;
    }

    int
    _foobar_pack (extension_priv_data_t epriv, gnutls_buffer_st * ps)
    {
       /* Append the extension's internal state to buffer */
       return 0;
    }

    int
    _foobar_unpack (gnutls_buffer_st * ps, extension_priv_data_t * epriv)
    {
       /* Read the internal state from buffer */
       return 0;
    }

The `_foobar_recv_params' function is responsible for parsing incoming
extension data (both in the client and server).

The `_foobar_send_params' function is responsible for sending extension
data (both in the client and server).

If you receive length fields that don't match, return
`GNUTLS_E_UNEXPECTED_PACKET_LENGTH'.  If you receive invalid data,
return `GNUTLS_E_RECEIVED_ILLEGAL_PARAMETER'.  You can use other error
codes from the list in *note Error codes::.  Return 0 on success.

An extension typically stores private information in the `session' data
for later usage. That can be done using the functions
`_gnutls_ext_set_session_data' and `_gnutls_ext_get_session_data'. You
can check simple examples at `ext/max_record.c' and `ext/server_name.c'
extensions.  That private information can be saved and restored across
session resumption if the following functions are set:

The `_foobar_pack' function is responsible for packing internal
extension data to save them in the session resumption storage.

The `_foobar_unpack' function is responsible for restoring session data
from the session resumption storage.

Recall that both the client and server, send and receive parameters,
and your code most likely will need to do different things depending on
which mode it is in.  It may be useful to make this distinction
explicit in the code.  Thus, for example, a better template than above
would be:

    int
    _gnutls_foobar_recv_params (gnutls_session_t session,
                                const opaque * data,
                                size_t data_size)
    {
      if (session->security_parameters.entity == GNUTLS_CLIENT)
        return foobar_recv_client (session, data, data_size);
      else
        return foobar_recv_server (session, data, data_size);
    }

    int
    _gnutls_foobar_send_params (gnutls_session_t session,
                                gnutls_buffer_st * data)
    {
      if (session->security_parameters.entity == GNUTLS_CLIENT)
        return foobar_send_client (session, data);
      else
        return foobar_send_server (session, data);
    }

The functions used would be declared as `static' functions, of the
appropriate prototype, in the same file.  When adding the files, you'll
need to add them to `ext/Makefile.am' as well, for example:

    if ENABLE_FOOBAR
    libgnutls_ext_la_SOURCES += ext/foobar.c ext/foobar.h
    endif

Add API functions to enable/disable the extension.
..................................................

It might be desirable to allow users of the extension to request use of
the extension, or set extension specific data.  This can be implemented
by adding extension specific function calls that can be added to
`includes/gnutls/gnutls.h', as long as the LGPLv2.1+ applies.  The
implementation of the function should lie in the `ext/foobar.c' file.

To make the API available in the shared library you need to add the
symbol in `lib/libgnutls.map', so that the symbol is exported properly.

When writing GTK-DOC style documentation for your new APIs, don't
forget to add `Since:' tags to indicate the GnuTLS version the API was
introduced in.

Adding a new Supplemental Data Handshake Message
------------------------------------------------

TLS handshake extensions allow to send so called supplemental data
handshake messages [_RFC4680_]. This short section explains how to
implement a supplemental data handshake message for a given TLS
extension.

First of all, modify your extension `foobar' in the way, the that flags
`session->security_parameters.do_send_supplemental' and
`session->security_parameters.do_recv_supplemental' are set:

    int
    _gnutls_foobar_recv_params (gnutls_session_t session, const opaque * data,
                                     size_t _data_size)
    {
       ...
       session->security_parameters.do_recv_supplemental=1;
       ...
    }

    int
    _gnutls_foobar_send_params (gnutls_session_t session, gnutls_buffer_st *extdata)
    {
       ...
       session->security_parameters.do_send_supplemental=1;
       ...
    }

Furthermore add the functions `_foobar_supp_recv_params' and
`_foobar_supp_send_params' to `_foobar.h' and `_foobar.c'. The
following example code shows how to send a "Hello World" string in the
supplemental data handshake message:

    int
    _foobar_supp_recv_params(gnutls_session_t session, const opaque *data, size_t _data_size)
    {
       uint8_t len = _data_size;
       unsigned char *msg;

       msg = gnutls_malloc(len);
       if (msg == NULL) return GNUTLS_E_MEMORY_ERROR;

       memcpy(msg, data, len);
       msg[len]='\0';

       /* do something with msg */
       gnutls_free(msg);

       return len;
    }

    int
    _foobar_supp_send_params(gnutls_session_t session, gnutls_buffer_st *buf)
    {
       unsigned char *msg = "hello world";
       int len = strlen(msg);

       _gnutls_buffer_append_data_prefix(buf, 8, msg, len);

       return len;
    }

Afterwards, add the new supplemental data handshake message to
`lib/gnutls_supplemental.c' by adding a new entry to the
`_gnutls_supplemental[]' structure:

    gnutls_supplemental_entry _gnutls_supplemental[] =
    {
      {"foobar",
       GNUTLS_SUPPLEMENTAL_FOOBAR_DATA,
       _foobar_supp_recv_params,
       _foobar_supp_send_params},
      {0, 0, 0, 0}
    };

You have to include your `foobar.h' header file as well:

    #include "foobar.h"

Lastly, add the new supplemental data type to
`lib/includes/gnutls/gnutls.h':

    typedef enum
    {
        GNUTLS_SUPPLEMENTAL_USER_MAPPING_DATA = 0,
        GNUTLS_SUPPLEMENTAL_FOOBAR_DATA = 1
    } gnutls_supplemental_data_format_type_t;

Heartbeat extension.
....................

One such extension is HeartBeat protocol (RFC6520:
`https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6520') implementation. To enable it use
option -heartbeat with example client and server supplied with gnutls:

    ./doc/credentials/gnutls-http-serv --priority "NORMAL:-CIPHER-ALL:+NULL" -d 100 \
        --heartbeat --echo
    ./src/gnutls-cli --priority "NORMAL:-CIPHER-ALL:+NULL" -d 100 localhost -p 5556 \
        --insecure --heartbeat

After that pasting
    **HEARTBEAT**
command into gnutls-cli will trigger corresponding command on the
server and it will send HeartBeat Request with random length to client.

Another way is to run capabilities check with:

    ./doc/credentials/gnutls-http-serv -d 100 --heartbeat
    ./src/gnutls-cli-debug localhost -p 5556

10.5 Cryptographic Backend
==========================

Today most new processors, either for embedded or desktop systems
include either instructions  intended to speed up cryptographic
operations, or a co-processor with cryptographic capabilities. Taking
advantage of those is a challenging task for every cryptographic
application or library. Unfortunately the cryptographic library that
GnuTLS is based on takes no advantage of these capabilities. For this
reason GnuTLS handles this internally by following a layered approach
to accessing cryptographic operations as in *note fig-crypto-layers::.

 [image src="gnutls-crypto-layers.png" ]

Figure 10.4: GnuTLS cryptographic back-end design.

The TLS layer uses a cryptographic provider layer, that will in turn
either use the default crypto provider - a software crypto library, or
use an external crypto provider, if available in the local system. The
reason of handling the external cryptographic provider in GnuTLS and
not delegating it to the cryptographic libraries, is that none of the
supported cryptographic libraries support `/dev/crypto' or
CPU-optimized cryptography in an efficient way.

Cryptographic library layer
---------------------------

The Cryptographic library layer, currently supports only libnettle.
Older versions of GnuTLS used to support libgcrypt, but it was switched
with nettle mainly for performance reasons(1) and secondary because it
is a simpler library to use.  In the future other cryptographic
libraries might be supported as well.

External cryptography provider
------------------------------

Systems that include a cryptographic co-processor, typically come with
kernel drivers to utilize the operations from software. For this reason
GnuTLS provides a layer where each individual algorithm used can be
replaced by another implementation, i.e., the one provided by the
driver. The FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Linux kernels(2) include already a
number of hardware assisted implementations, and also provide an
interface to access them, called `/dev/crypto'.  GnuTLS will take
advantage of this interface if compiled with special options. That is
because in most systems where hardware-assisted cryptographic
operations are not available, using this interface might actually harm
performance.

In systems that include cryptographic instructions with the CPU's
instructions set, using the kernel interface will introduce an unneeded
layer. For this reason GnuTLS includes such optimizations found in
popular processors such as the AES-NI or VIA PADLOCK instruction sets.
This is achieved using a mechanism that detects CPU capabilities and
overrides parts of crypto back-end at runtime.  The next section
discusses the registration of a detected algorithm optimization. For
more information please consult the GnuTLS source code in
`lib/accelerated/'.

Overriding specific algorithms
..............................

When an optimized implementation of a single algorithm is available,
say a hardware assisted version of AES-CBC then the following
(internal) functions, from `crypto-backend.h', can be used to register
those algorithms.

   * `gnutls_crypto_single_cipher_register': To register a cipher
     algorithm.

   * `gnutls_crypto_single_digest_register': To register a hash
     (digest) or MAC algorithm.


Those registration functions will only replace the specified algorithm
and leave the rest of subsystem intact.

Overriding the cryptographic library
....................................

In some systems, that might contain a broad acceleration engine, it
might be desirable to override big parts of the cryptographic back-end,
or even all of them. The following functions are provided for this
reason.

   * `gnutls_crypto_cipher_register': To override the cryptographic
     algorithms back-end.

   * `gnutls_crypto_digest_register': To override the digest algorithms
     back-end.

   * `gnutls_crypto_rnd_register': To override the random number
     generator back-end.

   * `gnutls_crypto_bigint_register': To override the big number number
     operations back-end.

   * `gnutls_crypto_pk_register': To override the public key encryption
     back-end. This is tied to the big number operations so either none
     or both of them should be overridden.

Appendix A Upgrading from previous versions
*******************************************

The GnuTLS library typically maintains binary and source code
compatibility across versions. The releases that have the major version
increased break binary compatibility but source compatibility is
provided.  This section lists exceptional cases where changes to
existing code are required due to library changes.

Upgrading to 2.12.x from previous versions
==========================================

GnuTLS 2.12.x is binary compatible with previous versions but changes
the semantics of `gnutls_transport_set_lowat', which might cause
breakage in applications that relied on its default value be 1. Two
fixes are proposed:
   * Quick fix. Explicitly call `gnutls_transport_set_lowat (session,
     1);' after *note gnutls_init::.

   * Long term fix. Because later versions of gnutls abolish the
     functionality of using the system call `select' to check for
     gnutls pending data, the function *note
     gnutls_record_check_pending:: has to be used to achieve the same
     functionality as described in *note Asynchronous operation::.

Upgrading to 3.0.x from 2.12.x
==============================

GnuTLS 3.0.x is source compatible with previous versions except for the
functions listed below.

Old function           Replacement
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
`gnutls_transport_set_lowat' To replace its functionality the function
                       *note gnutls_record_check_pending:: has to
                       be used, as described in *note
                       Asynchronous operation::
`gnutls_session_get_server_random',They are replaced by the safer function
`gnutls_session_get_client_random'*note gnutls_session_get_random::
`gnutls_session_get_master_secret'Replaced by the keying material exporters
                       discussed in *note Deriving keys for other
                       applications/protocols::
`gnutls_transport_set_global_errno'Replaced by using the system's errno
                       fascility or *note
                       gnutls_transport_set_errno::.
`gnutls_x509_privkey_verify_data'Replaced by *note
                       gnutls_pubkey_verify_data::.
`gnutls_certificate_verify_peers'Replaced by *note
                       gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2::.
`gnutls_psk_netconf_derive_key'Removed. The key derivation function was
                       never standardized.
`gnutls_session_set_finished_function'Removed.
`gnutls_ext_register'  Removed. Extension registration API is now
                       internal to allow easier changes in the
                       API.
`gnutls_certificate_get_x509_crls',Removed to allow updating the internal
`gnutls_certificate_get_x509_cas'structures. Replaced by *note

`gnutls_certificate_get_openpgp_keyring'Removed.
`gnutls_ia_'           Removed. The inner application extensions
                       were completely removed (they failed to be
                       standardized).

Upgrading to 3.1.x from 3.0.x
=============================

GnuTLS 3.1.x is source and binary compatible with GnuTLS 3.0.x
releases. Few functions have been deprecated and are listed below.

Old function           Replacement
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
`gnutls_pubkey_verify_hash'The function *note
                       gnutls_pubkey_verify_hash2:: is provided
                       and is functionally equivalent and safer
                       to use.
`gnutls_pubkey_verify_data'The function *note
                       gnutls_pubkey_verify_data2:: is provided
                       and is functionally equivalent and safer
                       to use.

Upgrading to 3.2.x from 3.1.x
=============================

GnuTLS 3.2.x is source and binary compatible with GnuTLS 3.1.x
releases. Few functions have been deprecated and are listed below.

Old function           Replacement
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
`gnutls_privkey_sign_raw_data'The function *note
                       gnutls_privkey_sign_hash:: is equivalent
                       when the flag
                       `GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_SIGN_FLAG_TLS1_RSA' is
                       specified.

Upgrading to 3.3.x from 3.2.x
=============================

GnuTLS 3.3.x is source and binary compatible with GnuTLS 3.2.x releases;
however there few changes in semantics which are listed below.

Old function           Replacement
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
`gnutls_global_init'   No longer required. The library is
                       initialized using a constructor.
`gnutls_global_deinit' No longer required. The library is
                       deinitialized using a destructor.

B.1 Getting Help
================

A mailing list where users may help each other exists, and you can
reach it by sending e-mail to <gnutls-help@gnutls.org>.  Archives of
the mailing list discussions, and an interface to manage subscriptions,
is available through the World Wide Web at
`http://lists.gnutls.org/pipermail/gnutls-help/'.

A mailing list for developers are also available, see
`http://www.gnutls.org/lists.html'.  Bug reports should be sent to
<bugs@gnutls.org>, see *note Bug Reports::.

B.2 Commercial Support
======================

Commercial support is available for users of GnuTLS.  The kind of
support that can be purchased may include:

   * Implement new features.  Such as a new TLS extension.

   * Port GnuTLS to new platforms.  This could include porting to an
     embedded platforms that may need memory or size optimization.

   * Integrating TLS as a security environment in your existing project.

   * System design of components related to TLS.

B.3 Bug Reports
===============

If you think you have found a bug in GnuTLS, please investigate it and
report it.

   * Please make sure that the bug is really in GnuTLS, and preferably
     also check that it hasn't already been fixed in the latest version.

   * You have to send us a test case that makes it possible for us to
     reproduce the bug.

   * You also have to explain what is wrong; if you get a crash, or if
     the results printed are not good and in that case, in what way.
     Make sure that the bug report includes all information you would
     need to fix this kind of bug for someone else.


Please make an effort to produce a self-contained report, with
something definite that can be tested or debugged.  Vague queries or
piecemeal messages are difficult to act on and don't help the
development effort.

If your bug report is good, we will do our best to help you to get a
corrected version of the software; if the bug report is poor, we won't
do anything about it (apart from asking you to send better bug reports).

If you think something in this manual is unclear, or downright
incorrect, or if the language needs to be improved, please also send a
note.

Send your bug report to:

                           `bugs@gnutls.org'

B.4 Contributing
================

If you want to submit a patch for inclusion - from solving a typo you
discovered, up to adding support for a new feature - you should submit
it as a bug report, using the process in *note Bug Reports::.  There
are some things that you can do to increase the chances for it to be
included in the official package.

Unless your patch is very small (say, under 10 lines) we require that
you assign the copyright of your work to the Free Software Foundation.
This is to protect the freedom of the project.  If you have not already
signed papers, we will send you the necessary information when you
submit your contribution.

For contributions that doesn't consist of actual programming code, the
only guidelines are common sense.  For code contributions, a number of
style guides will help you:

   * Coding Style.  Follow the GNU Standards document.

     If you normally code using another coding standard, there is no
     problem, but you should use `indent' to reformat the code before
     submitting your work.

   * Use the unified diff format `diff -u'.

   * Return errors.  No reason whatsoever should abort the execution of
     the library.  Even memory allocation errors, e.g. when malloc
     return NULL, should work although result in an error code.

   * Design with thread safety in mind.  Don't use global variables.
     Don't even write to per-handle global variables unless the
     documented behaviour of the function you write is to write to the
     per-handle global variable.

   * Avoid using the C math library.  It causes problems for embedded
     implementations, and in most situations it is very easy to avoid
     using it.

   * Document your functions.  Use comments before each function
     headers, that, if properly formatted, are extracted into Texinfo
     manuals and GTK-DOC web pages.

   * Supply a ChangeLog and NEWS entries, where appropriate.

B.5 Certification
=================

Many cryptographic libraries claim certifications from national or
international bodies. These certifications are tied on a specific (and
often restricted) version of the library or a specific product using
the library, and typically in the case of software they assure that the
algorithms implemented are correct. The major certifications known are:
   * USA's FIPS 140-2 at Level 1 which certifies that approved
     algorithms are used (see
     `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIPS_140-2');

   * Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation
     (CC), an international standard for verification of elaborate
     security claims (see
     `http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Criteria').

Obtaining such a certification is an expensive and elaborate job that
has no immediate value for a continuously developed free software
library (as the certification is tied to the particular version
tested), and in the case of algorithm verification of FIPS 140-2 it
doesn't make much sense as the library is freely available and anyone
can verify the correctness of algorithm implementation. As such we are
not actively pursuing this kind of certification. If you are,
nevertheless, interested, see *note Commercial Support::.

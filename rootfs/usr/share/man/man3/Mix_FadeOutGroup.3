.SH NAME
Mix_FadeOutGroup \- Halt a playing group of channels by arbitrary tag, after fading them out for a specified time\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int Mix_FadeOutGroup(int tag, int ms);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This will begin fading a group of channels with a specific tag from their
current volumes to silence over
.BR ms
milliseconds\[char46] After that time, those
channels are halted\[char46]

A tag is an arbitrary number that can be assigned to several mixer
channels, to form groups of channels\[char46]

The default tag for a channel is -1\[char46]

Any halted channels will have any currently-registered effects
deregistered, and will call any callback specified by

.BR Mix_ChannelFinished
() once the halt occurs\[char46]

A fading channel will change it's volume progressively, as if

.BR Mix_Volume
() was called on it (which is to say: you probably
shouldn't call 
.BR Mix_Volume
() on a fading channel)\[char46]

Note that this function does not block for the number of milliseconds
requested; it just schedules the group to fade and notes the time for the
mixer to manage later, and returns immediately\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I tag
an arbitrary value, assigned to channels, to search for\[char46]
.TP
.I ms
number of milliseconds to fade before halting the group\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of channels that were scheduled for fading\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.TH Mix_CloseAudio 3 "SDL_mixer 3.0.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
Mix_CloseAudio \- Close the mixer, halting all playing audio\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void Mix_CloseAudio(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Any halted channels will have any currently-registered effects
deregistered, and will call any callback specified by

.BR Mix_ChannelFinished
() before this function returns\[char46]

Any halted music will call any callback specified by

.BR Mix_HookMusicFinished
() before this function
returns\[char46]

Do not start any new audio playing during callbacks in this function\[char46]

This will close the audio device\[char46] Attempting to play new audio after this
function returns will fail, until another successful call to

.BR Mix_OpenAudio
()\[char46]

Note that (unlike 
.BR Mix_OpenAudio
 optionally calling
SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_AUDIO) on the app's behalf), this will _not_ deinitialize
the SDL audio subsystem in any case\[char46] At some point after calling this
function and 
.BR Mix_Quit
(), some part of the application should be
responsible for calling SDL_Quit() to deinitialize all of SDL, including
its audio subsystem\[char46]

This function should be the last thing you call in SDL_mixer before

.BR Mix_Quit
()\[char46] However, the following notes apply if you don't
follow this advice:

Note that this will not free any loaded chunks or music; you should dispose
of those resources separately\[char46] It is probably poor form to dispose of them
_after_ this function, but it is safe to call

.BR Mix_FreeChunk
() and 
.BR Mix_FreeMusic
() after
closing the device\[char46]

Note that any chunks or music you don't free may or may not work if you
call 
.BR Mix_OpenAudio
 again, as the audio device may be in a
new format and the existing chunks will not be converted to match\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

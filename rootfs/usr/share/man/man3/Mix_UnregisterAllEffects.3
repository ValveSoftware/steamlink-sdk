.TH Mix_UnregisterAllEffects 3 "SDL_mixer 3.0.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
Mix_UnregisterAllEffects \- Explicitly unregister all special effect functions\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int Mix_UnregisterAllEffects(int channel);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
You may not need to call this at all, unless you need to stop all effects
from processing in the middle of a chunk's playback\[char46]

Note that this will also shut off some internal effect processing, since

.BR Mix_SetPanning
() and others may use this API under the
hood\[char46] This is called internally when a channel completes playback\[char46]
Posteffects are never implicitly unregistered as they are for channels, but
they may be explicitly unregistered through this function by specifying

.BR MIX_CHANNEL_POST
 for a channel\[char46]

Note that unlike most SDL and SDL_mixer functions, this function returns
zero if there's an error, not on success\[char46] We apologize for the API design
inconsistency here\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I channel
the channel to unregister all effects on, or 
.BR MIX_CHANNEL_POST
\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns zero if error (no such channel), nonzero if all effects
removed\[char46] Error messages can be retrieved from

.BR Mix_GetError
()\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

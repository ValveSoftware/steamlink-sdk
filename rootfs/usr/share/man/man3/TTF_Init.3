.SH NAME

.PP
.BI "int TTF_Init(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
You must successfully call this function before it is safe to call any
other function in this library, with one exception: a human-readable error
message can be retrieved from 
.BR TTF_GetError
() if this
function fails\[char46]

SDL must be initialized before calls to functions in this library, because
this library uses utility functions from the SDL library\[char46]

It is safe to call this more than once; the library keeps a counter of init
calls, and decrements it on each call to 
.BR TTF_Quit
, so you must
pair your init and quit calls\[char46]

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 0 on success, -1 on error\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_ttf 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.SH SEE ALSO

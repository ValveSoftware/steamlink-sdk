.TH Mix_HookMusic 3 "SDL_mixer 3.0.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
Mix_HookMusic \- Add your own music player or additional mixer function\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void Mix_HookMusic(Mix_MixCallback mix_func, void *arg);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This works something like 
.BR Mix_SetPostMix
(), but it has
some crucial differences\[char46] Note that an app can use this _and_

.BR Mix_SetPostMix
() at the same time\[char46] This allows an app to
replace the built-in music playback, either with it's own music decoder or
with some sort of procedurally-generated audio output\[char46]

The supplied callback will fire every time SDL_mixer is preparing to supply
more data to the audio device\[char46] This runs inside an SDL audio callback, so
it's important that the callback return quickly, or there could be problems
in the audio playback\[char46]

Running this callback is the first thing SDL_mixer will do when starting to
mix more audio\[char46] The buffer will contain silence upon entry, so the callback
does not need to mix into existing data or initialize the buffer\[char46]

Note that while a callback is set through this function, SDL_mixer will not
mix any playing music; this callback is used instead\[char46] To disable this
callback (and thus reenable built-in music playback) call this function
with a NULL callback\[char46]

The data written to by the callback is in the format that the audio device
was opened in, and upon return from the callback, SDL_mixer will mix any
playing chunks (but not music!) into the buffer\[char46] The callback cannot resize
the buffer (so you must be prepared to provide exactly the amount of data
demanded or leave it as silence)\[char46]

The
.BR arg
pointer supplied here is passed to the callback as-is, for
whatever the callback might want to do with it (keep track of some ongoing
state, settings, etc)\[char46]

As there is only one music "channel" mixed, there is only one callback
available\[char46] If you need to mix multiple inputs, be prepared to handle them
from a single function\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I mix_func
the callback function to become the new post-mix callback\[char46]
.TP
.I arg
a pointer that is passed, untouched, to the callback\[char46]
.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

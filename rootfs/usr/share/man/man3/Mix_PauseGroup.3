channel will continue to mix the chunk where it left off\[char46]

()\[char46]

A paused channel with an expiration will not expire while paused (the
expiration countdown will be adjusted once resumed)\[char46]

channels, to form groups of channels\[char46]

The default tag for a channel is -1\[char46]

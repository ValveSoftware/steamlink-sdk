.TH Mix_SetReverseStereo 3 "SDL_mixer 3.0.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
Mix_SetReverseStereo \- Cause a channel to reverse its stereo\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int Mix_SetReverseStereo(int channel, int flip);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This is handy if the user has his speakers hooked up backwards, or you
would like to have a trippy sound effect\[char46]

Calling this function with
.BR flip
set to non-zero reverses the chunks's
usual channels\[char46] If
.BR flip
is zero, the effect is unregistered\[char46]

This uses the 
.BR Mix_RegisterEffect
() API internally,
and thus is probably more CPU intensive than having the user just plug in
his speakers correctly\[char46] 
.BR Mix_SetReverseStereo
()
returns without registering the effect function if the audio device is not
configured for stereo output\[char46]

If you specify 
.BR MIX_CHANNEL_POST
 for
.BR channel
, then
this effect is used on the final mixed stream before sending it on to the
audio device (a posteffect)\[char46]

Note that unlike most SDL and SDL_mixer functions, this function returns
zero if there's an error, not on success\[char46] We apologize for the API design
inconsistency here\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I channel
The mixer channel to reverse, or 
.BR MIX_CHANNEL_POST
\[char46]
.TP
.I flip
non-zero to reverse stereo, zero to disable this effect\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns zero if error (no such channel or

.BR Mix_RegisterEffect
() fails), nonzero if reversing
effect is enabled\[char46] Note that an audio device in mono mode is a no-op, but
this call will return successful in that case\[char46] Error messages can be
retrieved from 
.BR Mix_GetError
()\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.TH Mix_ExpireChannel 3 "SDL_mixer 3.0.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
Mix_ExpireChannel \- Change the expiration delay for a particular channel\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int Mix_ExpireChannel(int channel, int ticks);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The channel will halt after the 'ticks' milliseconds have elapsed, or
remove the expiration if 'ticks' is -1\[char46]

This overrides the value passed to the fourth parameter of

.BR Mix_PlayChannelTimed
()\[char46]

Specifying a channel of -1 will set an expiration for _all_ channels\[char46]

Any halted channels will have any currently-registered effects
deregistered, and will call any callback specified by

.BR Mix_ChannelFinished
() once the halt occurs\[char46]

Note that this function does not block for the number of ticks requested;
it just schedules the chunk to expire and notes the time for the mixer to
manage later, and returns immediately\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I channel
the channel to change the expiration time on\[char46]
.TP
.I ticks
number of milliseconds from now to let channel play before halting, -1 to not halt\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns the number of channels that changed expirations\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.TH Mix_LoadMUSType_RW 3 "SDL_mixer 3.0.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
Mix_LoadMUSType_RW \- Load an audio format into a music object, assuming a specific format\[char46]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "Mix_Music * Mix_LoadMUSType_RW(SDL_RWops *src, Mix_MusicType type, SDL_bool freesrc);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
SDL_mixer has two separate data structures for audio data\[char46] One it calls a
"chunk," which is meant to be a file completely decoded into memory up
front, and the other it calls "music" which is a file intended to be
decoded on demand\[char46] Originally, simple formats like uncompressed WAV files
were meant to be chunks and compressed things, like MP3s, were meant to be
music, and you would stream one thing for a game's music and make repeating
sound effects with the chunks\[char46]

In modern times, this isn't split by format anymore, and most are
interchangeable, so the question is what the app thinks is worth
predecoding or not\[char46] Chunks might take more memory, but once they are loaded
won't need to decode again, whereas music always needs to be decoded on the
fly\[char46] Also, crucially, there are as many channels for chunks as the app can
allocate, but SDL_mixer only offers a single "music" channel\[char46]

This function loads music data, and lets the application specify the type
of music being loaded, which might be useful if SDL_mixer cannot figure it
out from the data stream itself\[char46]

Currently, the following types are supported:

-
.BR MUS_NONE
(SDL_mixer should guess, based on the data)
-
.BR MUS_WAV
(Microsoft WAV files)
-
.BR MUS_MOD
(Various tracker formats)
-
.BR MUS_MID
(MIDI files)
-
.BR MUS_OGG
(Ogg Vorbis files)
-
.BR MUS_MP3
(MP3 files)
-
.BR MUS_FLAC
(FLAC files)
-
.BR MUS_OPUS
(Opus files)
-
.BR MUS_WAVPACK
(WavPack files)

If
.BR freesrc
is SDL_TRUE, the RWops will be closed before returning,
whether this function succeeds or not\[char46] SDL_mixer reads everything it needs
from the RWops during this call in any case\[char46]

As a convenience, there is a function to read files from disk without
having to deal with SDL_RWops:
.BR Mix_LoadMUS("filename\[char46]mp3")
will manage
those details for you (but not let you specify the music type explicitly)\[char46]\[char46]

When done with this music, the app should dispose of it with a call to

.BR Mix_FreeMusic
()\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I src
an SDL_RWops that data will be read from\[char46]
.TP
.I type
the type of audio data provided by
.BR src
\[char46]
.TP
.I freesrc
SDL_TRUE to close/free the SDL_RWops before returning, SDL_FALSE to leave it open\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns a new music object, or NULL on error\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

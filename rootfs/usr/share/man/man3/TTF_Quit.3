.TH TTF_Quit 3 "SDL_ttf 3.0.0" "SDL_ttf" "SDL_ttf3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
TTF_Quit \- Deinitialize SDL_ttf\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_ttf/SDL_ttf\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_ttf/SDL_ttf.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void TTF_Quit(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
You must call this when done with the library, to free internal resources\[char46]
It is safe to call this when the library isn't initialized, as it will just
return immediately\[char46]

Once you have as many quit calls as you have had successful calls to

.BR TTF_Init
, the library will actually deinitialize\[char46]

Please note that this does not automatically close any fonts that are still
open at the time of deinitialization, and it is possibly not safe to close
them afterwards, as parts of the library will no longer be initialized to
deal with it\[char46] A well-written program should call

.BR TTF_CloseFont
() on any open fonts before calling this
function!

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_ttf 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.TH Mix_GetSoundFonts 3 "SDL_mixer 3.0.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
Mix_GetSoundFonts \- Get SoundFonts paths to use by supported MIDI backends\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "const char* Mix_GetSoundFonts(void);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
There are several factors that determine what will be reported by this
function:


\(bu If the boolean _SDL hint_
.BR "SDL_FORCE_SOUNDFONTS"
is set, AND the
.BR "SDL_SOUNDFONTS"
_environment variable_ is also set, this function will
  return that environment variable regardless of whether
  
.BR Mix_SetSoundFounts
() was ever called\[char46]

\(bu Otherwise, if 
.BR Mix_SetSoundFonts
() was successfully
  called with a non-NULL path, this function will return the string passed
  to that function\[char46]

\(bu Otherwise, if the
.BR "SDL_SOUNDFONTS"
variable is set, this function will
  return that environment variable\[char46]

\(bu Otherwise, this function will search some common locations on the
  filesystem, and if it finds a SoundFont there, it will return that\[char46]

\(bu Failing everything else, this function returns NULL\[char46]

This returns a pointer to internal (possibly read-only) memory, and it
should not be modified or free'd by the caller\[char46]

.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns semicolon-separated list of sound font paths\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

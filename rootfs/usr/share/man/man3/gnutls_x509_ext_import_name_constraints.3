.SH NAME
gnutls_x509_ext_import_name_constraints \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/x509-ext.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_x509_ext_import_name_constraints(const gnutls_datum_t * " ext ", gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t " nc ", unsigned int " flags ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "const gnutls_datum_t * ext" 12
a DER encoded extension
.IP "gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t nc" 12
The nameconstraints intermediate structure
.IP "unsigned int flags" 12
zero or \fBGNUTLS_NAME_CONSTRAINTS_FLAG_APPEND\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function will return an intermediate structure containing
the name constraints of the provided NameConstraints extension. That
structure can be used in combination with \fBgnutls_x509_name_constraints_check()\fP
to verify whether a server's name is in accordance with the constraints.

When the  \fIflags\fP is set to \fBGNUTLS_NAME_CONSTRAINTS_FLAG_APPEND\fP, then if 
the  \fInc\fP structure is empty
this function will behave identically as if the flag was not set.
Otherwise if there are elements in the  \fInc\fP structure then only the
excluded constraints will be appended to the constraints.

Note that  \fInc\fP must be initialized prior to calling this function.
.SH "RETURNS"
On success, \fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) is returned, \fBGNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE\fP
if the extension is not present, otherwise a negative error value.
.SH "SINCE"
3.3.0

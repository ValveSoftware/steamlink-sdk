.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS

.PP
.BI "int Mix_SetSoundFonts(const char *paths);

.SH DESCRIPTION
You may specify multiple paths in a single string by separating them with
semicolons; they will be searched in the order listed\[char46]

This function replaces any previously-specified paths\[char46]

Passing a NULL path will remove any previously-specified paths\[char46]

Note that unlike most SDL and SDL_mixer functions, this function returns
zero if there's an error, not on success\[char46] We apologize for the API design
inconsistency here\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I paths
Paths on the filesystem where SoundFonts are available, separated by semicolons\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns 1 if successful, 0 on error (out of memory)\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

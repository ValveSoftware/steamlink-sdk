.SH NAME
Mix_ChannelFinished \- Set a callback that runs when a channel has finished playing\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void Mix_ChannelFinished(Mix_ChannelFinishedCallback channel_finished);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The callback may be called from the mixer's audio callback or it could be
called as a result of 
.BR Mix_HaltChannel
(), etc\[char46]

The callback has a single parameter,
.BR channel
, which says what mixer
channel has just stopped\[char46]

Do not call SDL_LockAudio() from this callback; you will either be inside
the audio callback, or SDL_mixer will explicitly lock the audio before
calling your callback\[char46]

A NULL pointer will disable the callback\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I channel_finished
the callback function to become the new notification mechanism\[char46]
.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

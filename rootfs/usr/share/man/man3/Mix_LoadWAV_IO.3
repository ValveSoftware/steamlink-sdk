.TH Mix_LoadWAV_IO 3 "SDL_mixer 3.0.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
Mix_LoadWAV_IO \- Load a supported audio format into a chunk\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "Mix_Chunk * Mix_LoadWAV_IO(SDL_IOStream *src, SDL_bool closeio);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
SDL_mixer has two separate data structures for audio data\[char46] One it calls a
"chunk," which is meant to be a file completely decoded into memory up
front, and the other it calls "music" which is a file intended to be
decoded on demand\[char46] Originally, simple formats like uncompressed WAV files
were meant to be chunks and compressed things, like MP3s, were meant to be
music, and you would stream one thing for a game's music and make repeating
sound effects with the chunks\[char46]

In modern times, this isn't split by format anymore, and most are
interchangeable, so the question is what the app thinks is worth
predecoding or not\[char46] Chunks might take more memory, but once they are loaded
won't need to decode again, whereas music always needs to be decoded on the
fly\[char46] Also, crucially, there are as many channels for chunks as the app can
allocate, but SDL_mixer only offers a single "music" channel\[char46]

If
.BR closeio
is SDL_TRUE, the IOStream will be closed before returning,
whether this function succeeds or not\[char46] SDL_mixer reads everything it needs
from the IOStream during this call in any case\[char46]

There is a separate function (a macro, before SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0) to read
files from disk without having to deal with SDL_IOStream:
.BR Mix_LoadWAV("filename\[char46]wav")
will call this function and manage those
details for you\[char46]

When done with a chunk, the app should dispose of it with a call to

.BR Mix_FreeChunk
()\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I src
an SDL_IOStream that data will be read from\[char46]
.TP
.I closeio
SDL_TRUE to close the SDL_IOStream before returning, SDL_FALSE to leave it open\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
(
.BR Mix_Chunk
 *) Returns a new chunk, or NULL on error\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0

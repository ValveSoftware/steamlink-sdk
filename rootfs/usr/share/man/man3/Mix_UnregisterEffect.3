.TH Mix_UnregisterEffect 3 "SDL_mixer 3.0.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
Mix_UnregisterEffect \- Explicitly unregister a special effect function\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int Mix_UnregisterEffect(int channel, Mix_EffectFunc_t f);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
You may not need to call this at all, unless you need to stop an effect
from processing in the middle of a chunk's playback\[char46]

Posteffects are never implicitly unregistered as they are for channels (as
the output stream does not have an end), but they may be explicitly
unregistered through this function by specifying

.BR MIX_CHANNEL_POST
 for a channel\[char46]

Note that unlike most SDL and SDL_mixer functions, this function returns
zero if there's an error, not on success\[char46] We apologize for the API design
inconsistency here\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I channel
the channel to unregister an effect on, or 
.BR MIX_CHANNEL_POST
\[char46]
.TP
.I f
effect the callback stop calling in future mixing iterations\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns zero if error (no such channel or effect), nonzero if
removed\[char46] Error messages can be retrieved from

.BR Mix_GetError
()\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.TH Mix_QuickLoad_WAV 3 "SDL_mixer 3.0.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
Mix_QuickLoad_WAV \- Load a WAV file from memory as quickly as possible\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "Mix_Chunk * Mix_QuickLoad_WAV(Uint8 *mem);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
Unlike 
.BR Mix_LoadWAV_IO
, this function has several
requirements, and unless you control all your audio data and know what
you're doing, you should consider this function unsafe and not use it\[char46]


\(bu The provided audio data MUST be in Microsoft WAV format\[char46]

\(bu The provided audio data shouldn't use any strange WAV extensions\[char46]

\(bu The audio data MUST be in the exact same format as the audio device\[char46] This
  function will not attempt to convert it, or even verify it's in the right
  format\[char46]

\(bu The audio data must be valid; this function does not know the size of the
  memory buffer, so if the WAV data is corrupted, it can read past the end
  of the buffer, causing a crash\[char46]

\(bu The audio data must live at least as long as the returned
  
.BR Mix_Chunk
, because SDL_mixer will use that data directly and
  not make a copy of it\[char46]

This function will do NO error checking! Be extremely careful here!

(Seriously, use 
.BR Mix_LoadWAV_IO
 instead\[char46])

If this function is successful, the provided memory buffer must remain
available until 
.BR Mix_FreeChunk
() is called on the returned
chunk\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I mem
memory buffer containing of a WAV file\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
(
.BR Mix_Chunk
 *) Returns a new chunk, or NULL on error\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.SH SEE ALSO

.BR Mix_LoadWAV_IO (3),

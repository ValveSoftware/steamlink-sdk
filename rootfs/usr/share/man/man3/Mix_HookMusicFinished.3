.TH Mix_HookMusicFinished 3 "SDL_mixer 3.0.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
Mix_HookMusicFinished \- Set a callback that runs when a music object has stopped playing\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "void Mix_HookMusicFinished(Mix_MusicFinishedCallback music_finished);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This callback will fire when the currently-playing music has completed, or
when it has been explicitly stopped from a call to

.BR Mix_HaltMusic
\[char46] As such, this callback might fire from an
arbitrary background thread at almost any time; try to limit what you do
here\[char46]

It is legal to start a new music object playing in this callback (or
restart the one that just stopped)\[char46] If the music finished normally, this
can be used to loop the music without a gap in the audio playback\[char46]

Do not call SDL_LockAudio() from this callback; you will either be inside
the audio callback, or SDL_mixer will explicitly lock the audio before
calling your callback\[char46]

A NULL pointer will disable the callback\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I music_finished
the callback function to become the new notification mechanism\[char46]
.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

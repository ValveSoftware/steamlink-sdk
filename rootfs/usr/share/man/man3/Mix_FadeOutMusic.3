.TH Mix_FadeOutMusic 3 "SDL_mixer 3.0.0" "SDL_mixer" "SDL_mixer3 FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
Mix_FadeOutMusic \- Halt the music stream after fading it out for a specified time\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "int Mix_FadeOutMusic(int ms);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
This will begin the music fading from its current volume to silence over
.BR ms
milliseconds\[char46] After that time, the music is halted\[char46]

Any halted music will call any callback specified by

.BR Mix_HookMusicFinished
() once the halt occurs\[char46]

Fading music will change it's volume progressively, as if

.BR Mix_VolumeMusic
() was called on it (which is to say: you
probably shouldn't call 
.BR Mix_VolumeMusic
() on a fading
channel)\[char46]

Note that this function does not block for the number of milliseconds
requested; it just schedules the music to fade and notes the time for the
mixer to manage later, and returns immediately\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I ms
number of milliseconds to fade before halting the channel\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns non-zero if music was scheduled to fade, zero otherwise\[char46] If
no music is currently playing, this returns zero\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

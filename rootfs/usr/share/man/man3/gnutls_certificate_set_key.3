.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This function sets a certificate/private key pair in the
gnutls_certificate_credentials_t structure.  This function may be
called more than once, in case multiple keys/certificates exist for
the server.  For clients that wants to send more than its own end
entity certificate (e.g., also an intermediate CA cert) then put
the certificate chain in  \fIpcert_list\fP . 

Note that the  \fIpcert_list\fP and  \fIkey\fP will become part of the credentials 
structure and must not be deallocated. They will be automatically deallocated 
when the  \fIres\fP structure is deinitialized.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP (0) on success, or a negative error code.
.SH "SINCE"
3.0

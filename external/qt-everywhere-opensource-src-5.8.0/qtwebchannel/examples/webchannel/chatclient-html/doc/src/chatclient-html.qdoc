    \title Qt WebChannel ChatClient HTML Example
    \ingroup qtwebchannel-examples
    \brief A HTML/JavaScript client that communicates over a WebSocket with a QWebChannel server.

    \image chatclient-html.png

    \e{ChatClient HTML} provides a simple QWebChannel client implemented using JavaScript and HTML.

    \section1 Running the Example

    To run the example, open the \c chatclient.html file in a browser.

    \section1 Implementing a Web Channel Client

    The client initializes a WebSocket connection to the chat server and receives an object
    containing all the necessary signals, slots, and properties for implementing a chat client.

    After login, the client can invoke the method \c sendMessage and receive the signal \c newMessage
    to send and receive messages. Furthermore, a \c userList property provides the names of
    all other connected clients. The list is automatically updated when its contents change.
    Also, the client responds to the server's keep alive signal which is needed to detect disconnected
    clients and remove them from the \c userList property.

    The example shows how basic elements can be used with the client JavaScript implementation of
    QWebChannel, like connecting to signals (\c newMessage), calling slots (\c sendMessage), and handling
    property changes (\c userList).

    The client is able to work with \l{Qt WebChannel ChatServer Example}.

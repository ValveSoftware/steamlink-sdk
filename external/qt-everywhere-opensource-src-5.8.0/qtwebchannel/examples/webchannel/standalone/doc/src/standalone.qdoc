    \brief A simple chat between a server and a remote client running in a
    browser.

    \e{Standalone} demonstrates how to use the QWebChannel C++ API to
    communicate with an external client. It is a simple chat between a C++
    application and a remote HTML client running in your default browser.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \section1 Communicating with a Remote Client

    The C++ application sets up a QWebChannel instance and publishes a \c Dialog object over it.
    For the remote client side, \l {standalone/index.html}{index.html} is opened. Both show a
    dialog with the list of received messages and an input box to send messages to the other end.

    The \c Dialog emits the \c Dialog::sendText() signal when the user sends a message. The signal
    automatically gets propagated to the HTML client. When the user enters a message on the HTML
    side, \c Dialog::receiveText() is called.

    All communication between the HTML client and the C++ server is done over a WebSocket.
    The C++ side instantiates a QWebSocketServer and wraps incoming QWebSocket connections
    in QWebChannelAbstractTransport objects. These objects are
    then connected to the QWebChannel instance.

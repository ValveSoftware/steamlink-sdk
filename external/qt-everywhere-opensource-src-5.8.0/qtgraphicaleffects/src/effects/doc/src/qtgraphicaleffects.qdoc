    \brief The Qt Graphical Effects module provides a range of stunning
    visual effects that can be applied to Qt Quick applications.

    The \l{qtgraphicaleffects-index.html}{Qt Graphical Effects} module provides a set of QML types for
    adding visually impressive and configurable effects to user
    interfaces. Effects are visual items that can be added to Qt Quick
    user interface as UI components.

    To use the types in this module, import the module with the following line:
    \qml
    import QtGraphicalEffects 1.0
    \endqml

\brief Qt Graphical Effects module is a Qt Quick Add-On module.

The Qt Graphical Effects module provides a set of QML types for adding visually
impressive and configurable effects to user interfaces. Effects are visual
items that can be added to Qt Quick user interface as UI components.

The API consists of over 20 effects provided as separate QML types. The effects
cover functional areas such as blending, masking, blurring, coloring, and many more.

\section1 Getting Started
To load Qt Graphical Effects, add the following import statement to your .qml file:
\snippet Blend-example.qml import

To use the effects, simply add a specific effect declaration to the QML scene and
configure the effects properties. Effects have one or more source properties for
specifying the visual input for which the effect is applied to. The altered visual
output is then presented in the effect item itself. The source can be another,
often hidden, item in the QML scene. More complex effects can have multiple sources.
The source item type can be any QML type, even video or another effect. Pipelining
multiple effects together is a simple way to create even more impressive output.

Each effect has a set of properties that can be used to configure the effect output.
Properties can be animated just like any other QML properties. The QML type
documentation contains property descriptions and basic usage examples.

Currently there is no C++ API.

\note Some effects may not be available with all graphics APIs. OpenGL, which is
used by default in most cases, has full support for all of them.  However, the
\c software backend for instance does not support effects at all. Therefore,
when running with graphics APIs other than OpenGL, refer to the documentation of
the QML types in question to check if the effect is available. For more
information on the Qt Quick scene graph backends, see
\l{qtquick-visualcanvas-adaptations.html}{Scene Graph Adaptations}.

    \title SatelliteInfo (C++/QML)

    \brief The SatelliteInfo example shows how the available satellites
    at the user's current position and marks the satellites
    currently contributing to the GPS fix as pink.

    \ingroup qtpositioning-examples

    Key \l{Qt Positioning} classes used in this example:

    \list
    \li \l{QGeoSatelliteInfo}
    \li \l{QGeoSatelliteInfoSource}
    \endlist

    \image ../images/example-satelliteinfo.png

    The example displays the signal strength of all satellites in view. Any satellite
    that is currently used to calculate the GPS fix has been marked pink. The number at
    the bottom of each signal bar is the individual satellite identifier.

    The application operates in three different modes:

    \table
        \header
            \li Application mode
            \li Description
        \row
            \li running
            \li The application continuously queries the system for satellite updates. When new data
                is available it will be displayed.
        \row
            \li stopped
            \li The application stops updating the satellite information.
        \row
            \li single
            \li The application makes a single update request with a timeout of 10s. The display
                remains empty until the request was answered by the system.
    \endtable

    If the platform does not provide satellite information the application automatically
    switches into a demo mode whereby it continuously switches between predefined
    sets of satellite data.

    \brief The Positioning module provides positioning information via QML and C++ interfaces.

    To load the Qt Positioning module, add the following statement to your .qml files

    \snippet doc_src_qtpositioning.qml import

    For C++ projects include the header appropriate for the current use case,
    for example applications using routes may use

    \code #include <QGeoCoordinate> \endcode

    The .pro file should have the \e positioning keyword added

    \code QT += positioning \endcode

\title Qt Positioning
\brief The Qt Positioning API provides positioning information via QML and C++ interfaces.
\ingroup technology-apis

The Qt Positioning API provides positioning information via QML and C++ interfaces.

Currently the API is supported on \l {Qt for Android}{Android}, \l {Qt for iOS}{iOS},
\l {Qt for macOS}{\macos},
\l {Qt for Linux/X11}{Linux} (using
\l {http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/GeoClue}{GeoClue version 0.12.99}),
\l {Qt for Windows}{Windows} (with GPS receivers exposed as a serial port providing NMEA sentences),
and \l {Qt for WinRT}{WinRT} (using Windows.Devices.Geolocation).

\section1 Overview

The Qt Positioning API gives developers the ability to determine a position by
using a variety of possible sources, including satellite, or wifi, or text file,
and so on. That information can then be used to for example determine a position
on a map. In addition satellite information can be retrieved and area based monitoring
can be performed.

\section1 Getting Started

To load the Qt Positioning module, add the following statement to your .qml files

\snippet doc_src_qtpositioning.qml import

For C++ projects include the header appropriate for the current use case,
for example applications using routes may use

\code #include <QGeoCoordinate> \endcode

The .pro file should have the \e positioning keyword added

\code QT += positioning \endcode

\section1 Related Information
\section2 Overview

Positioning includes all the functionality necessary to find and work with geographic
coordinates. It can use a variety of external sources of information, including GPS. This
provides us with a coordinate and altitude for the device with additional features
such as speed and direction. This provides the fundamental location information used in the API.

    \title Qt Location Examples
    \brief Examples for the Qt Location module
    \ingroup all-examples
    \ingroup qtlocation

    These examples show a range of different uses for \l{Qt Location},
    such as displaying a map within a QML user interface, implementing basic routing and
    place search, as well as integrating positioning data types.

    These examples can work with any of the available geo services plugins. However, some plugins may
    require additional \l {QtLocation::PluginParameter}{plugin parameters} in order to function correctly.
    The default plugin used by these examples is \l {Qt Location Open Street Map Plugin}, which does not
    require any parameters.

\title Qt Location C++ API
\brief Information about the Qt Location C++ API

The Location API provides a library for mapping, navigation and place information.

\tableofcontents

The Qt Location API provides the developer with a set of functions to interact
with maps, navigational data and places of interest. This is particularly useful
when associated with current position information which can be retrieved via the
\l QtPositioning module.

With the Maps API we can associate a position with a map in various formats supplied by a backend.
Then the Places API could be used to populate places on the Map or even
specify the current position as a place of interest and associate it with
an icon, contact details and other information.

The following table provides links to more detailed information on sections of the
Qt Location C++ API.

\section1 Maps and Navigation Classes

Currently it is not possible to interact with maps data via C++. The only available interface is the \l {Maps and Navigation (QML)} API.

    \brief This is a demonstration of how to use axes in your QML application.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \section1 Using Axes in Qt Quick Applications

    We begin with a chart that has a line series and a scatter series with random
    data. Both series use the same axes.

    The next example shows a chart with some accurate historical data that makes us to use a DateTimeAxis.

    And the final example with a chart that uses a CategoryAxis to make the data easier to understand.

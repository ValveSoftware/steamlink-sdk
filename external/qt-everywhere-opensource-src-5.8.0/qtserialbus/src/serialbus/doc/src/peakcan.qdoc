    \title Using PeakCAN Plugin

    \brief Overview of how to use the PeakCAN plugin.

    The PeakCAN plugin encapsulates the low-level API to work with the
    \l{http://www.peak-system.com/}{PEAK-System} CAN adapters.

    \section1 Creating CAN Bus Devices

    At first it is necessary to check that QCanBus provides the desired plugin:

    \code
        if (QCanBus::instance()->plugins().contains(QStringLiteral("peakcan"))) {
            // plugin available
        }
    \endcode

    Where \e peakcan is the plugin name.

    Next, a connection to a specific interface can be established:

    \code
        QCanBusDevice *device = QCanBus::instance()->createDevice(
            QStringLiteral("peakcan"), QStringLiteral("usb0"));
        device->connectDevice();
    \endcode

    Where \e usb0 is the active CAN interface name. The PeakCAN plugin supports
    eight USB interfaces from \e usb0 to \e usb7 and eight PCI interfaces from
    \e pci0 to \e pci7.

    \note Only the USB and PCI adapters are currently supported by this plugin.

    The device is now open for writing and reading CAN frames:

    \code
        QCanBusFrame frame;
        frame.setFrameId(8);
        QByteArray payload("A36E");
        frame.setPayload(payload);
        device->writeFrame(frame);
    \endcode

    The reading can be done using the \l {QCanBusDevice::}{readFrame()} method. The
    \l {QCanBusDevice::}{framesReceived()} signal is emitted when at least one new frame
    is available for reading:

    \code
        QCanBusFrame frame = device->readFrame();
    \endcode

    PeakCAN supports the following configurations that can be controlled through
    \l {QCanBusDevice::}{setConfigurationParameter()}:

    \table
        \header
            \li Configuration parameter key
            \li Description
        \row
            \li QCanBusDevice::BitRateKey
            \li Determines the bit rate of the CAN bus connection. The following bit rates
                are supported: 5000, 10000, 20000, 33000, 47000, 50000, 83000, 95000,
                100000, 125000, 250000, 500000, 800000, 1000000. Note that this configuration
                parameter can only be adjusted while the QCanBusDevice is not connected.
   \endtable

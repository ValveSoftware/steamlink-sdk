    \ingroup qtquickexamples

    \e Views is a collection of small QML examples relating to model and view
    functionality. They demonstrate how to show data from a model using the
    Qt Quick view types. For more information, visit the
    \l{Models and Views in Qt Quick} page.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \section1 GridView and PathView

    \e GridView and \e PathView demonstrate usage of these types to display
    views.

    \section1 Dynamic List

    \e{Dynamic List} demonstrates animation of runtime additions and removals to
    a \l ListView.

    The ListView.onAdd signal handler runs an animation when new items are added
    to the view, and the ListView.onRemove another when they are removed.

    \section2 Expanding Delegates

    \e{Expanding Delegates} demonstrates delegates that expand when activated.

    It has a complex delegate the size and appearance of which can change,
    displacing other items in the view.

    \section1 Sections

    \e Sections demonstrates the various section headers and footers available
    to \l ListView.
    \snippet views/listview/sections.qml 0

    \section1 Packages

    \e Packages uses the \l Package type to transition delegates between
    two views.

    It has a Package object which defines delegate items for each view and an
    item that can be transferred between delegates.

    \snippet views/package/Delegate.qml 0

    A \l DelegateModel allows the individual views to access their specific
    items from the shared package delegate.

    \snippet views/package/view.qml 0

    \section1 ObjectModel

    \e ObjectModel uses an ObjectModel for the model instead of a \l ListModel.

    \snippet views/objectmodel/objectmodel.qml 0

    \section1 Display Margins

    \e{Display Margins} uses delegates to display items and implements a simple
    header and footer components.

    \section1 AnimatedSprite

    \e AnimatedSprite shows how to display a simple animation using an
    \l AnimatedSprite object:
    \snippet imageelements/animatedsprite.qml sprite
    The sprite animation will loop three times.

    \section1 SpriteSequence

    \e SpriteSequence demonstrates using a sprite sequence to draw an animated
    and interactive bear. The \l SpriteSequence object defines five different
    sprites. The bear is initially in a \e still state:
    \snippet imageelements/spritesequence.qml still

    When the scene is clicked, an animation sets the sprite sequence to the
    \e falling states and animates the bear's y property.
    \snippet imageelements/spritesequence.qml animation

    At the end of the animation the bear is set back to its initial state.

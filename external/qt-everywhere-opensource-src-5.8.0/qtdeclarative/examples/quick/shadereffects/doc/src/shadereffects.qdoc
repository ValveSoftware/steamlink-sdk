    \title Qt Quick Examples - Shader Effects

    \brief A Qt Quick example demonstrating the use of shader effects.
    \ingroup qtquickexamples

    This example demonstrates a couple of visual effects that you can perform
    with shaders in Qt Quick. It applies five different effects on a text and
    a couple of images. For more information, visit
    \l{Important Concepts In Qt Quick - Graphical Effects}

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \section1 Using ShaderEffect

    The \l ShaderEffect type typically operates on other types, using a
    \l ShaderEffectSource:
    \snippet shadereffects/shadereffects.qml source

    In the above snippet, \c theItem is the ID of a complex QML object in the
    file.

    ShaderEffects can use this ShaderEffectSource as a texture in their fragment
    shader:
    \snippet shadereffects/shadereffects.qml fragment

    In order to support multiple graphics APIs, not just OpenGL, the shader
    source is not embedded into QML. Instead, file selectors are used to select
    the correct variant at runtime. Based on the Qt Quick backend in use, Qt
    will automatically select either \c{shaders/wobble.frag} with the GLSL
    source code or \c{shaders/+hlsl/wobble.frag} with the HLSL source code.

    \note For simplicity shader source code is used in all variants of the
    files. However, with the Direct3D backend of Qt Quick pre-compiled shaders
    are also supported. For example, try the following commands in the
    \c{content/shaders/+hlsl} directory: \c{move wobble.frag wobble.frag.src}
    followed by \c{fxc /E main /T ps_5_0 /Fo wobble.frag wobble.frag.src}. Now
    \c wobble.frag contains Direct3D bytecode and that is what gets shipped
    with the application instead of the shader source. Further changes are not
    necessary, the application will function like before.

    You can use any custom property on the ShaderEffect in your shader. This
    makes animated shader code very easy:
    \snippet shadereffects/shadereffects.qml properties

    ShaderEffects can also have a custom vertext shader. Setting the mesh
    property on ShaderEffect provides more vertices for you to manipulate,
    enabling more effects.

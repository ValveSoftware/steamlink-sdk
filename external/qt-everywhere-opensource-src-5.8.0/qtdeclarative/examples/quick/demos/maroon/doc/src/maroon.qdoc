    \e{Maroon in Trouble} demonstrates QML features that are useful when
    developing games:

    \list
        \li Using custom QML types to create different screens for
            different stages of the game.
        \li Using the \l Item and \l Image types to construct a game background.
        \li Using the SequentialAnimation, NumberAnimation, ParticleSystem,
            \l Emitter, and \l Wander types to animate background objects.
        \li Using the \l Timer and \l Repeater types to display a countdown
            sequence before starting the game.
        \li Using a custom QML type with custom properties to construct a game
            board.
        \li Using the SpriteSequence and \l Sprite types to add animated objects
            to the game board.
        \li Using a custom QML type that uses the \l Image type with some custom
            properties to add a menu where the players can buy objects.
        \li Using custom properties with private functions to keep track of game
            statistics and a custom QML type to display them to the players.
        \li Using the \l State type with JavaScript functions to manage game
            states.
        \li Using the \l SoundEffect type to play individual sound effects
            depending on the object type and the action applied to the object.
        \li Using signal handlers to specify keyboard shortcuts for some game
            actions.
        \li Using resource files to package game resources for deployment and
            delivery.
    \endlist

    \section1 Adding Screens

    In the Maroon in Trouble app, we use the following custom types that
    are each defined in a separate .qml file to create the game screens:

    \list
        \li NewGameScreen.qml
        \li GameCanvas.qml
        \li GameOverScreen.qml
    \endlist

    To use the custom types, we add an import statement to the main QML file,
    maroon.qml that imports the folder called \c content where the types are
    located:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/maroon.qml
    \skipto content
    \printuntil "

    We use the screen types at different stages of the game. The NewGameScreen
    type is used to create the screen that appears when the players start the
    app. In NewGameScreen.qml, we use an \l{Image} type to create a New Game
    button that the players can press to start a new game.

    \image qtquick-demo-maroon-med-1.png

    Tapping the button initiates a countdown timer that triggers the creation
    of the game canvas by using the GameCanvas type. Another \l{Timer} type
    spawns mobs of fish inside bubbles that the players must free before they
    reach the surface. The players can tap on the screen to open a menu where
    they can buy different types of weapons (melee, ranged, and bombs) to burst
    the bubbles.

    \image qtquick-demo-maroon-med-2.png

    When the game finishes, a screen created by using the GameOverScreen type
    appears. On this screen, the players can see their score and start a new
    game.

    \image qtquick-demo-maroon-med-3.jpg

    The screens are all created on the same background and use some of the same
    images and animations.

    \section1 Constructing the Background

    In the maroon.qml file, we use an \l{Item} type with the id \c root and a
    fixed width and height to create a main window for the game:

    \skipto Item
    \printuntil passedSplash

    We declare two custom properties for the root item, \c gameState and
    \c passedSplash that we will use later to manage game states.

    We use an \l{Image} item to display the game background image:

    \printuntil anchors.bottom

    We want to be able to load the background image only once at app startup
    and still use different scenes for the game screens. Therefore,
    background.png is three times the length of the root item and displays a
    scene that stretches from the bottom of sea to the sky above the horizon.

    We use the \c anchors.bottom property to anchor the background image to the
    bottom of the \l{Column} layout that we use to position the screens:

    \skipto Column
    \printuntil GameOverScreen

    We set a negative value for the \c y property to set the first scene at the
    bottom of the sea. We calculate the position by subtracting the height of
    a screen from the \c height property.

    Within the column layout, we use an \l{Item} type to add objects to the
    background. Within the item, we use \l{Row} layout objects to position
    \l{Image} objects that display waves on the game canvas and the game over
    screen:

    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }
    \dots
    \skipto Row
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    The second row of waves is positioned on the y axis with a slight offset to
    the first row. We also use the \c opacity property to make the waves appear
    lighter in color than the first two waves, which gives the background some
    depth.

    We use \l{Image} objects to also display sunlight on the new game screen and
    on the game canvas:

    \skipto Image
    \printuntil anchors
    \dots
    \skipto Image
    \printuntil anchors

    We set the \c opacity property of the images to \c 0.02 and \c 0.04 to give
    some depth to the rays of sunshine. We use the \c y property to position the
    images at fixed locations on the y axis and the
    \c {anchors.horizontalCenter} property to center them horizontally in
    relation to their parent.

    We use an \l {Image} type to display an image that adds a deepening shadow
    to the background:

    \skipto Image
    \printuntil }

    We set the \c opacity property of the image to \c 0.5 to make the background
    visible behind the shadow.

    To make the background more interesting, we animate some of the objects we
    added to it.

    \section1 Animating Background Objects

    We use NumberAnimation to move the waves horizontally across the screen in
    opposite directions and SequentialAnimation with NumberAnimation to move
    them up and down.

    We apply the number animation to the \c x property of \c wave as a property
    value source to animate the x value from its current value to the
    \c -(wave.width), over 16 seconds. We set the \c loops property to
    \c {Animation.Infinite} to repeat the animation indefinitely:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/maroon.qml
    \skipto wave.width
    \printuntil }

    We apply the sequential animation to the \c y property of the image as a
    property value source to animate the y value. We use one number animation
    to animate the image from the y position of two below the value of y to two
    above it, over 1600 milliseconds. We use another number animation to
    subsequently animate the image in the opposite direction, again over 1600
    milliseconds. The animation is repeated indefinitely:

    \skipto SequentialAnimation
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    We use the easing curve of the type \c {Easing.InOutQuad} for a quintic
    (t^5) function to accelerate the motion until halfway and then decelerate
    it.

    We use sequential animation and number animation to animate \c wave2
    similarly to \c wave, but in the opposite direction:

    \skipto SequentialAnimation
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    We use sequential animation to rotate the rays of sunlight in degrees
    clockwise around an origin point that we set to \c {Item.Top} in the
    \c transformOrigin property. The animation is repeated indefinitely:

    \skipto transformOrigin
    \printuntil to: -10
    \printuntil }

    We use one number animation to rotate the image from \c -10 degrees to
    \c 10 degrees over 8 seconds and another to subsequently rotate it from
    \c 10 degrees to \c -10 degrees over the same duration.

    We use the easing curve of the type \c {Easing.InOutSine} for a sinusoidal
    (sin(t)) function to accelerate the motion until halfway and then decelerate
    it.

    We use sequential animation and number animation to animate another
    sunlight.png image similarly, but in the opposite direction:

    \skipto transformOrigin
    \printuntil to: 10
    \printuntil }

    For examples of using SequentialAnimation and NumberAnimation on the \c x
    and \c y properties and the \c width and \c height properties, see
    NewGameScreen.qml.

    \section1 Emitting Particles

    In addition to animation, we use particles to generate motion on the game
    screens. We use the ParticleSystem QML type in maroon.qml to make bubbles
    appear at the bottom of the new game screen and game canvas and slowly float
    towards the top on varying trajectories.

    To use the ParticleSystem type, we must import \l{Qt Quick Particles QML Types}:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/maroon.qml
    \skipto Particles
    \printuntil 0

    To have the particles appear on the game background, we place the
    ParticleSystem type within the \l{Image} type that displays the game
    background:

    \skipto Image
    \printuntil anchors.fill

    In the ParticleSystem, we use an \l{Emitter} type to emit particles from the
    location of the emitter at the rate of two per second with the life span of
    15 seconds:

    \skipto Emitter
    \printuntil sizeVariation
    \printuntil }

    The \c acceleration property uses the PointDirection type to
    specify random variation of the x and y coordinates, so that the bubbles
    appear inside a rectangular area around the emitter that is anchored to the
    bottom of the image.

    The \c size property sets the base size of the particles at the beginning of
    their life to 24 pixels and the \c sizeVariation property randomly increases
    or decreases the particle size by up to 16 pixels, so that we get bubbles in
    different sizes.

    As emitters have no visualization, we use the ImageParticle type to render
    the catch.png image at the particle location:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/maroon.qml
    \skipto ImageParticle
    \printuntil }

    A \l{Wander} type applies a random trajectory to the particles, so that the
    bubbles follow random routes from the bottom to the top.

    \printuntil }

    For another example of using the ParticleSystem type, see the
    GameOverScreen.qml file, where an ImageParticle type is used to make clouds
    move across the sky.

    \section1 Using Timers

    \image qtquick-demo-maroon-med-4.jpg

    In maroon.qml, we use the \l{Timer} type with a \l{Repeater} type to display
    a countdown sequence before using another timer to start a new game. Both
    timers are started simultaneously in the \c "gameOn" state, that is when the
    players tap the New Game button and \c passedSplash is \c true. This is
    explained in more detail in \l{Managing Game States}.

    We use the \c countdownTimer to display the countdown sequence:

    \skipto Timer
    \printuntil }

    The \c onTriggered signal handler is called when the timer is triggered to
    increment the value of the \c countdown custom property.

    We set the \c repeat property to \c true to specify that the timer is
    triggered at the interval of 1 second as long as the value of \c countdown
    is less than 5.

    The \c countdown property is defined in the root item with an initial value
    of \c 10, so that \c countdownTimer is not running by default:

    \skipto countdown:
    \printuntil 10

    Each time the timer is triggered, an image from the countdown sequence is
    displayed. We use a \l{Repeater} type to instantiate the \l{Image} delegate
    in the context of the repeater's parent, \c canvasArea item, seeded with
    data from the \c model:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/maroon.qml
    \skipto Repeater
    \printuntil scale
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    We scale the images from \c 0.0 to \c 1.0 and use the \c visible property to
    hide the images for the previous steps as the countdown progresses. We also
    raise the opacity of the image that matches the current countdown step,
    keeping the others nearly transparent.

    By animating the changes in the \c opacity and \c scale properties using a
    \l Behavior type, we achieve a countdown sequence where numbers zoom in
    towards the players.

    \section1 Constructing the Game Board

    To construct the game board, we use the GameCanvas custom type that is
    defined in GameCanvas.qml.

    In maroon.qml, we use the GameCanvas type to display the game canvas
    at the position of 32 on the x axis and 20 pixels from the bottom of
    its parent item, \c canvasArea:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/maroon.qml
    \skipto GameCanvas
    \printuntil }

    We set the \c focus property to \c true to give \c canvas active focus on
    startup.

    In GameCanvas.qml, we use an \l Item type and define custom properties for
    it to create a grid of equally sized squares divided to 4 columns on 6 rows:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/content/GameCanvas.qml
    \skipto Item
    \printuntil canvas

    We use the custom properties to set the \c width and \c height of the
    \c grid item as the amount of columns and rows multiplied by square size:

    \skipto width
    \printuntil height

    We use an \l{Image} type with a MouseArea type to display a help button
    that the players can tap to view an image that contains instructions for
    playing the game:

    \skipuntil endGame
    \skipto Image
    \printuntil bottomMargin
    \printuntil }

    We declare the \c goAway() private function to disable the mouse area and
    make the image fully transparent and a \c comeBack() function to enable the
    mouse area and make the button fully opaque. We use a \l {Behavior} type on
    the \c opacity property to apply the default number animation when the value
    of \c opacity changes.

    When the players tap the help button, the \c onClicked signal handler is
    called to hide the help button by setting the \c {helpButton.visible}
    property to \c false and to show the help image by setting the
    \c {helpImage.visible} property to \c false.

    \image qtquick-demo-maroon-med-6.jpg

    We use anchoring to position the help button at the bottom center of the
    game canvas.

    We use another \l{Image} type to display the help image:

    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    To hide the help image when the players tap it, the \c onClicked signal
    handler within the MouseArea type is called to set the \c{helpImage.visible}
    property to \c true.

    To ensure that the images are placed on top when they are visible, we set
    a high value for their \c z property.

    The following sections describe how to use timers to add animated objects to
    the game board and how to create a menu dialog from which the players can
    add more objects to it.

    \section1 Animating Objects on the Game Board

    We use sprite animation to animate objects on the game board. The Qt Quick
    \l{Sprite Animations}{sprite engine} is a stochastic state machine combined
    with the ability to chop up images containing multiple frames of an
    animation.

    \section2 Spawning Fish

    We use a \l{Timer} element with the \c tick() function in GameCanvas.qml to
    spawn mobs of fish in waves at an increasing rate, starting at 16
    milliseconds:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/content/GameCanvas.qml
    \skipto Timer
    \printuntil }

    We use the MobBase custom type that is defined in MobBase.qml to
    animate mobs of fish that swim inside bubbles. We use an \l{Item} type with
    custom properties and private functions to create the fish and the bubbles
    and to define the actions that can be applied to them:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/content/mobs/MobBase.qml
    \skipto Item
    \printuntil }
    \dots

    We use a SpriteSequence type to animate the fish:

    \skipto SpriteSequence
    \printuntil goalSprite

    The SpriteSequence type renders and controls a list of animations
    defined by \l{Sprite} types:

    \skipto Sprite {
    \printuntil name: "right"
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    In the \c fishSprite sprite sequence, each sprite defines one frame within
    the mob-idle.png file, which shows a fish facing right, front, and left:

    \image ../../content/gfx/mob-idle.png

    We use the \c frameWidth, \c frameHeight, and \c frameX properties to
    determine that the first 64x64-pixel square of the image is framed in the
    \c "left" sprite, the second in the \c "front" sprite, and the third in the
    \c "right" sprite. For each sprite, the \c frameCount property is set to
    \c 1 to specify that the sprite contains one frame.

    We use the \c frameDuration and \c frameDurationVariation properties to
    specify that the duration of an animation can vary from \c 400 to \c 1200
    milliseconds.

    The \c to property specifies that the sprites have weighted transitions to
    other sprites. The \c "left" and \c "right" sprites always transfer to the
    \c "front" sprite. When the \c "front" animation finishes, the sprite engine
    chooses \c "left" or \c "right" randomly, but at roughly equal proportions,
    because they both have the weight \c 1.

    When the fish are set free, we want them to swim away in the direction they
    are facing until they get off the screen. If they were facing front, we use
    the \c jumpTo method with the JavaScript \c {Math.random()} method in the
    \c die() private function to randomly jump to the \c "left" or \c "right"
    sprite:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/content/mobs/MobBase.qml
    \skipto die()
    \printuntil }

    We then use the \c start() function to run a NumberAnimation that applies a
    number animation to the x value from its current value to \c -360 or \c 360,
    depending on whether the \c goingLeft custom property is \c true, in 300
    milliseconds:

    \skipto NumberAnimation
    \printuntil }

    \section2 Bursting Bubbles

    We use another SpriteSequence to animate the bubbles so that they
    become smaller and finally burst when they are attacked by a shooter or
    a melee. For this effect, we set the value of the \c scale property to
    decrease by \c 0.2 each time the custom \c hp property changes:

    \skipto SpriteSequence
    \printuntil goalSprite

    We use a \l{Behavior} type to apply a NumberAnimation when the value of
    \c scale changes. We use the \c{Easing.OutBack} easing type for a back
    (overshooting cubic function: (s+1)*t^3 - s*t^2) easing out curve that
    decelerates the motion to zero velocity in 150 milliseconds:

    \skipto Behavior
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    The SpriteSequence consist of two sprites that display different images. The
    first sprite, \c "big", uses the catch.png image to display an empty bubble:

    \skipto Sprite
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    We set the \c to property to \c "burst" with the weight \c 0 to make the
    second sprite, \c "burst", a valid goal for the \c jumpTo method that we use
    in the \c die() private function to jump directly to the \c "burst" sprite
    without playing the first sprite.

    In the \c "burst" sprite, we set the \c frameCount property to \c 3 and the
    \c frameX property to \c 64 to specify that the animation starts at pixel
    location 64 and loads each frame for the duration of 200 milliseconds.

    \skipto Sprite
    \printuntil }

    Within the SpriteSequence, we use SequentialAnimation with NumberAnimation
    to animate the transitions between the frames. To create a pulsating effect
    on the bubbles, we apply a sequential animation on the \c width property
    with two number animations to first increase the bubble width from
    \c{* 1} to \c{* 1.1} over 800 milliseconds and then bring it back over 1
    second:

    \skipto SequentialAnimation
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    Similarly, we increase the bubble height from \c{* 1} to \c{* 1.15} over
    1200 milliseconds and then bring it back over 1 second:

    \skipto SequentialAnimation
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    We use yet another SpriteSequence to display the effect of squid ink on the
    bubbles. For more examples of using sprite sequences, see the QML files in
    the \c towers directory.

    \section1 Adding Dialogs

    \image qtquick-demo-maroon-med-5.jpg

    In GameCanvas.qml, we use an \l{Image} type with some custom properties to
    create a menu where the players can buy tower objects:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/content/GameCanvas.qml
    \skipto Image
    \printuntil towerExists

    We set the \c visible property to \c false to hide the menu by default. The
    \c z property is set to 1500 to ensure that the menu is displayed in front
    of all other items when it is visible.

    We use a MouseArea type to open or close the menu when players tap on the
    canvas:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/content/GameCanvas.qml
    \skipto MouseArea
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    We set the \c anchors.fill property to \c parent to allow the players to tap
    anywhere on the game canvas. We use a condition in the \c onClicked
    signal handler to call the \c {finish()} function if the menu is visible
    and the \c {open()} function otherwise.

    The \c {finish()} function hides the menu by setting the \c shown custom
    property to \c false:

    \skipto finish
    \printuntil }

    The \c {open()} function displays the menu at the x and y position of the
    mouse pointer:

    \printuntil }

    If \c gameRunning is \c true, we call the JavaScript \c row() function to
    calculate the value of the \c targetRow custom property and the \c col()
    function to calculate the value of the \c targetCol custom property. If
    the value of \c targetRow equals \c 0, the y position is set to one square
    above the mouse pointer. Otherwise, it is set to one square below the mouse
    pointer.

    We use the \c towerIdx() function to set the value of the \c towerExists
    custom property.

    We set the \c shown custom property to \c true to show the menu and call the
    \c {helpButton.goAway()} function to hide the help button when the menu
    opens.

    We use states and transitions to display the menu when the \c shown
    property is \c true and the \c gameOver property is \c false:

    \printuntil OutElastic
    \printuntil }

    To set the visibility of the menu to \c "visible" without animating the
    property change, we use a PropertyAction type. We do want to animate the
    changes in opacity and scale, though, so we use number animation to
    animate the value of the \c scale property from \c 0.9 to \c 1 and the
    value of \c opacity property from \c 0.7 to \c 1, over 500 milliseconds.
    We use the \c {Easing.outElastic} easing type for an elastic (exponentially
    decaying sine wave) function easing curve that decelerates from zero
    velocity.

    To construct the menu, we use a BuildButton custom type that is defined in
    BuildButton.qml. In GameCanvas.qml, we create one build button for each
    tower object that the players can buy and position them in a \l{Row} layout
    in front of the menu background image, dialog.png:

    \printuntil dialog-factory.png
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    For each build button, we set the values of \c towerType and \c index custom
    properties that we define in BuildButton.qml.

    We use the \c canBuild custom property to prevent players from adding tower
    objects in locations where tower objects already exist.

    We use the \c source property to display the image for the tower type.

    The \c onClicked signal handler is called to execute the \c finish()
    function that closes the menu when the players tap an enabled build button.

    Build buttons are enabled when the players have enough coins to buy the
    tower objects. We use an \l {Image} type in BuildButton.qml to display
    images on the buttons:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/content/BuildButton.qml
    \skipto Image
    \printuntil }

    We use the \c opacity property to make the buttons appear enabled. If
    \c canBuild is \c true and the value of the \c gameCanvas.coins property
    is larger than or equal to the cost of a tower object, the images are fully
    opaque, otherwise their opacity is set to \c 0.4.

    We use a \l{Text} type to display the cost of each tower item, as specified
    by the \c towerData variable, depending on \c towerType:

    \skipto Text
    \printuntil }

    To display a pointer on the screen at the position where the tower object
    will be added, we use the \l {Image} type. We use the \c visible property
    to determine whether the dialog-pointer.png image should be positioned below
    or above the menu. When the value of the \c col property equals the \c index
    and the value or the \c row property is not \c 0, we anchor the image to the
    bottom of its parent, BuildButton.

    When the value or the \c row property is \c 0, we anchor the image to the
    top of BuildButton to position the pointer above the menu and use the
    \c rotation property to rotate it by 180 degrees, so that it points upwards:

    \skipto Image
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    \section1 Keeping Track of Game Statistics

    To keep track of the game statistics, we use the InfoBar custom type (that
    is defined in InfoBar.qml) in maroon.qml:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/maroon.qml
    \skipto InfoBar
    \printuntil }

    We use the \c {anchors.bottom} and \c {anchors.bottomMargin} properties to
    position the info bar at 6 points from the top of the game canvas. We bind
    the \c width property of the info bar to that of its parent.

    In InfoBar.qml, we use an \l{Item} type to create the info bar. Within it,
    we use a \l{Row} layout type to display the number of lives the players have
    left, the number of fish that have been saved, and the amount of coins that
    are available for use.

    We use the \c anchors property to position the rows in relationship to their
    parent and to each other. In the first \l{Row} object, we use the
    \c {anchors.left} and \c {anchors.leftMargin} properties to position the
    heart icons at 10 points from the left border of the parent item:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/content/InfoBar.qml
    \skipto Item
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    We use a \l{Repeater} type with a \c model and a \c delegate to display as
    many hearts as the players have lives left. We use the \c spacing property
    to leave 5 pixels between the displayed icons.

    In the second \l{Row} object, we use the \c {anchors.right} and
    \c {anchors.rightMargin} properties to position the number of fish saved at
    20 points left of the third \l{Row} object that displays the number of coins
    available (and has the id \c points):

    \skipto Row
    \printuntil /^\}/

    In these objects, we set spacing to 5 pixels to separate the icons from the
    numbers that we display by using a \l{Text} type.

    In GameCanvas.qml, we define custom properties to hold the game statistics:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/content/GameCanvas.qml
    \skipto score
    \printuntil lives

    We declare the \c freshState() function to set the initial game statistics
    when a new game starts:

    \skipto freshState()
    \printuntil }

    We use the \c {Logic.gameState.score} variable in the \c die() function
    that we declare in MobBase.qml to increase the score by one when the players
    set a fish free:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/content/mobs/MobBase.qml
    \skipto score
    \printuntil ;

    \section1 Managing Game States

    In maroon.qml, we use a \l{State} type and JavaScript to switch between
    screens according to the game state. The logic.js file contains definitions
    for the functions. To use the functions in a QML file, we import logic.js as
    the \c Logic namespace in that file:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/maroon.qml
    \skipto logic.js
    \printuntil Logic

    The base state displays the new game screen when the application starts.
    In addition, we call the Component.onCompleted signal handler to initialize
    a new game:

    \skipto newGameState
    \printuntil ;

    In NewGameScreen.qml we use the \c onClicked signal handler to emit the
    \c startButtonClicked() signal when the players tap the New Game button:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/content/NewGameScreen.qml
    \skipto to: 150
    \skipto Image
    \printuntil }

    In maroon.qml, we use the \c onStartButtonClicked signal handler to set the
    \c passedSplash property of the \c root item to \c true:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/maroon.qml
    \skipto NewGameScreen
    \printuntil }

    We then use the \c passedSplash property in the \c when property of the
    \c gameOn state to trigger the \c gameStarter timer:

    \skipto State {
    \printuntil gameStarter
    \printuntil }

    We also switch to the \c "gameOn" state and move to the y position
    \c  {-(height - 960)} to display the game canvas.

    In the \c gameStarter \l{Timer} object we use the \c onTriggered signal
    handler to call the \c startGame() function that starts a new game:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/maroon.qml
    \skipto property int
    \skipto Timer
    \printuntil }

    The game continues until \c gameState.gameOver is set to \c true and
    \c gameState.gameRunning is set to \c false by calling the \c endGame()
    function when the value of the \c gameState.lives property becomes less
    than or equal to \c 0.

    In GameOverScreen.qml, we use a MouseArea type and an \c onClicked signal
    handler within an \l{Image} type to return to the game canvas when the
    players tap the New Game button:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/content/GameOverScreen.qml
    \skipto opacity: 0.5
    \skipto Image
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    The \c onClicked signal handler triggers a state change in maroon.qml to
    display the game canvas:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/maroon.qml
    \skipto target: gameStarter
    \skipto State
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    \section1 Playing Sound Effects

    The app can play sound effects if the \l{Qt Multimedia} module is installed.
    In the SoundEffect.qml file, we proxy a SoundEffect type:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/content/SoundEffect.qml
    \skipto Item
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    We add the \c qtHaveModule() qmake command to the app .pro file, maroon.pro,
    to check whether the \l{Qt Multimedia} module is present:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/maroon.pro
    \skipto QT
    \printuntil multimedia

    In each QML file that defines a custom type used on the game canvas, we
    use a SoundEffect type to specify the audio file to play for that type
    of objects. For example, in Bomb.qml, we specify the sound that a bomb
    makes when it explodes:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/content/towers/Bomb.qml
    \skipto SoundEffect
    \printuntil }

    To play the sound effect when a bomb explodes, we call the \c sound.play()
    function that we declare as a member of the private \c fire() function
    within the TowerBase custom type:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/content/towers/Bomb.qml
    \skipto fire()
    \printuntil }

    For more examples of playing sound effects, see the QML files in the
    \c towers directory and MobBase.qml.

    \section1 Adding Keyboard Shortcuts

    This is a touch example, so you should not really need to handle key
    presses. However, we do not want you to have to spend more time playing the
    game than you want to while testing it, so we use the \c {Keys.onPressed}
    signal handler to specify keyboard shortcuts. You can press Shift+Up to
    increment the values of the \c coins property to add coins, Shift+Left to
    increment the value of \c lives, Shift+Down to increment the value of the
    \c waveProgress property to spawn mobs of fish faster, and Shift+Right to
    call the \c endGame() function to quit the game:

    \quotefromfile demos/maroon/content/GameCanvas.qml
    \skipto Keys
    \printuntil }

    \section1 Packaging Resources for Deployment

    To be able to run the app on mobile devices, we package all QML, JavaScript,
    image, and sound files into a Qt resource file (.qrc). For more information,
    see \l{The Qt Resource System}.

\title Exposing Attributes of C++ Types to QML
\brief Description of how to expose the attributes of a C++ type to QML

QML can easily be extended with functionality defined in C++ code. Due to the
tight integration of the QML engine with the \l{The Meta-Object System}{Qt
meta-object system}, any functionality that is appropriately exposed by a
QObject-derived class is accessible from QML code. This enables C++ data and
functions to be accessible directly from QML, often with little or no
modification.

The QML engine has the ability to introspect QObject instances through the
meta-object system. This means any QML code can access the following members of
an instance of a QObject-derived class:

\list
\li Properties
\li Methods (providing they are public slots or flagged with Q_INVOKABLE)
\li Signals
\endlist

(Additionally, enums are available if they have been declared with Q_ENUMS.
See \l{qtqml-cppintegration-data.html}{Data Type Conversion Between QML and C++}
for more details.)

In general, these are accessible from QML regardless of whether a
QObject-derived class has been \l{Registering C++ types with the QML type
system}{registered with the QML type system}. However, if a class is to be
used in a way that requires the engine to access additional type information
— for example, if the class itself is to be used as a method parameter or
property, or if one of its enum types is to be used in this way — then the
class may need to be registered.

Also note that a number of the important concepts covered in this document are
demonstrated in the \l{Writing QML Extensions with C++} tutorial.


\section1 Data Type Handling and Ownership

Any data that is transferred from C++ to QML, whether as a property value, a
method parameter or return value, or a signal parameter value, must be of a
type that is supported by the QML engine.

By default, the engine supports a number of Qt C++ types and can automatically
convert them as appropriately when used from QML. Additionally, C++ classes
that are \l{Registering C++ types with the QML type system}{registered} with
the QML type system can be used as data types, as can their enums if
appropriately registered. See \l{qtqml-cppintegration-data.html}{Data Type
Conversion Between QML and C++} for further information.

Additionally, data ownership rules are taken into consideration when data is
transferred from C++ to QML. See \l {Data Ownership} for more details.


\section1 Exposing Properties

A \e property can be specified for any QObject-derived class using the
Q_PROPERTY() macro. A property is a class data member with an associated read
function and optional write function.

All properties of a QObject-derived class are accessible from QML.

For example, below is a \c Message class with an \c author property. As
specified by the Q_PROPERTY macro call, this property is readable through
the \c author() method, and writable through the \c setAuthor() method:

\code
class Message : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT
    Q_PROPERTY(QString author READ author WRITE setAuthor NOTIFY authorChanged)
public:
    void setAuthor(const QString &a) {
        if (a != m_author) {
            m_author = a;
            emit authorChanged();
        }
    }
    QString author() const {
        return m_author;
    }
signals:
    void authorChanged();
private:
    QString m_author;
};
\endcode

If an instance of this class was \l{Embedding C++ Objects into QML with Context
Properties}{set as a context property} when loading a file named \c MyItem.qml
from C++:

\code
 int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
     QGuiApplication app(argc, argv);

     QQuickView view;
     Message msg;
     view.engine()->rootContext()->setContextProperty("msg", &msg);
     view.setSource(QUrl::fromLocalFile("MyItem.qml"));
     view.show();

     return app.exec();
 }
\endcode

Then, the \c author property could be read from \c MyItem.qml:

\qml
// MyItem.qml
import QtQuick 2.0

Text {
    width: 100; height: 100
    text: msg.author    // invokes Message::author() to get this value

    Component.onCompleted: {
        msg.author = "Jonah"  // invokes Message::setAuthor()
    }
}
\endqml

For maximum interoperability with QML, \b {any property that is writable should
have an associated NOTIFY signal} that is emitted whenever the property value
has changed. This allows the property to be used with \l{Property
Binding}{property binding}, which is an essential feature of QML that enforces
relationships between properties by automatically updating a property whenever
any of its dependencies change in value.

In the above example, the associated NOTIFY signal for the \c author property is
\c authorChanged, as specified in the Q_PROPERTY() macro call. This means that
whenever the signal is emitted — as it is when the author changes
in Message::setAuthor() — this notifies the QML engine that any
bindings involving the \c author property must be updated, and in turn, the
engine will update the \c text property by calling \c Message::author() again.

If the \c author property was writable but did not have an associated NOTIFY
signal, the \c text value would be initialized with the initial value returned
by \c Message::author() but would not be updated with any later changes to this
property. In addition, any attempts to bind to the property from QML will
produce a runtime warning from the engine.

\note It is recommended that the NOTIFY signal be named \e <property>Changed
where \c <property> is the name of the property. The associated property
change signal handler generated by the QML engine will always take the form
\c on<Property>Changed, regardless of the name of the related C++ signal, so
it is recommended that the signal name follows this convention to avoid any
confusion.


\section3 Notes on Use of Notify Signals

To prevent loops or excessive evaluation, developers should ensure that the
property change signal is only emitted when the property value has actually
changed. Also, if a property or group of properties is infrequently used, it
is permitted to use the same NOTIFY signal for several properties. This should
be done with care to ensure that performance doesn't suffer.

The presence of a NOTIFY signal does incur a small overhead. There are cases
where a property's value is set at object construction time, and does not
subsequently change. The most common case of this is when a type uses \l
{Grouped Properties}, and the grouped property object is allocated once, and
only freed when the object is deleted. In these cases, the CONSTANT
attribute may be added to the property declaration instead of a NOTIFY
signal.

The CONSTANT attribute should only be used for properties whose value is set,
and finalized, only in the class constructor.  All other properties that want
to be used in bindings should have a NOTIFY signal instead.


\section2 Properties with Object Types

Object-type properties are accessible from QML providing that the object type
has been appropriately \l{Registering C++ types with the QML type
system}{registered} with the QML type system.

For example, the \c Message type might have a \c body property of type
\c MessageBody*:

\code
class Message : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT
    Q_PROPERTY(MessageBody* body READ body WRITE setBody NOTIFY bodyChanged)
public:
    MessageBody* body() const;
    void setBody(MessageBody* body);
};

class MessageBody : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT
    Q_PROPERTY(QString text READ text WRITE text NOTIFY textChanged)
// ...
}
\endcode

Suppose the \c Message type was \l{Registering C++ types with the QML type
system}{registered} with the QML type system, allowing it to be used as an
object type from QML code:

\qml
Message {
    // ...
}
\endqml

If the \c MessageBody type was also registered with the type system, it would be
possible to assign \c MessageBody to the \c body property of a \c Message, all
from within QML code:

\qml
Message {
    body: MessageBody {
        text: "Hello, world!"
    }
}
\endqml


\section2 Properties with Object-List Types

Properties containing lists of QObject-derived types can also be exposed to
QML. For this purpose, however, one should use QQmlListProperty rather than
QList<T> as the property type. This is because QList is not a QObject-derived
type, and so cannot provide the necessary QML property characteristics
through the Qt meta object system, such as signal notifications when a list
is modified.

QQmlListProperty is a template class that can be conveniently constructed from
a QList value.

For example, the \c MessageBoard class below has a \c messages property of
type QQmlListProperty that stores a list of \c Message instances:

\code
class MessageBoard : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT
    Q_PROPERTY(QQmlListProperty<Message> messages READ messages)
public:
    QQmlListProperty<Message> messages() const;

private:
    static void append_message(QQmlListProperty<Message> *list, Message *msg);

    QList<Message *> m_messages;
};
\endcode

The MessageBoard::messages() function simply creates and returns a
QQmlListProperty from its QList<T> \c m_messages member, passing the
appropriate list modification functions as required by the QQmlListProperty
constructor:

\code
QQmlListProperty<Message> MessageBoard::messages()
{
    return QQmlListProperty<Message>(this, 0, &MessageBoard::append_message);
}

void MessageBoard::append_message(QQmlListProperty<Message> *list, Message *msg)
{
    MessageBoard *msgBoard = qobject_cast<MessageBoard *>(list->object);
    if (msg)
        msgBoard->m_messages.append(msg);
}
\endcode

Note that the template class type for the QQmlListProperty — in this case,
\c Message — must be \l{Registering C++ types with the QML type system}
{registered} with the QML type system.


\section2 Grouped Properties

Any read-only object-type property is accessible from QML code as a
\e {grouped property}. This can be used to expose a group of related
properties that describe a set of attributes for a type.

For example, suppose the \c Message::author property was of type
\c MessageAuthor rather than a simple string, with sub-properties
of \c name and \c email:

\code
class MessageAuthor : public QObject
{
    Q_PROPERTY(QString name READ name WRITE setName)
    Q_PROPERTY(QString email READ email WRITE setEmail)
public:
    ...
};

class Message : public QObject
{
    Q_OBJECT
    Q_PROPERTY(MessageAuthor* author READ author)
public:
    Message(QObject *parent)
        : QObject(parent), m_author(new MessageAuthor(this))
    {
    }
    MessageAuthor *author() const {
        return m_author;
    }
private:
    MessageAuthor *m_author;
};
\endcode

The \c author property could be written to using the
\l{qtqml-syntax-objectattributes.html#grouped-properties}{grouped property
syntax}
in QML, like this:

\qml
Message {
    author.name: "Alexandra"
    author.email: "alexandra@mail.com"
}
\endqml

A type that is exposed as a grouped property differs from an \l{Properties with
Object Types}{object-type property} in that the grouped property is read-only,
and is initialized to a valid value by the parent object at construction. The
grouped property's sub-properties may be modified from QML but the grouped
property object itself will never change, whereas an object-type property may be
assigned a new object value from QML at any time. Thus, the lifetime of a
grouped property object is controlled strictly by the C++ parent
implementation, whereas an object-type property can be freely created and
destroyed through QML code.


\section1 Exposing Methods (Including Qt Slots)

Any method of a QObject-derived type is accessible from QML code if it is:

\list
\li A public method flagged with the Q_INVOKABLE() macro
\li A method that is a public Qt \l{Signals & Slots}{slot}
\endlist

For example, the \c MessageBoard class below has a \c postMessage() method that
has been flagged with the Q_INVOKABLE macro, as well as a \c refresh() method
that is a public slot:

\code
 class MessageBoard : public QObject
 {
     Q_OBJECT
 public:
     Q_INVOKABLE bool postMessage(const QString &msg) {
         qDebug() << "Called the C++ method with" << msg;
         return true;
     }

 public slots:
     void refresh() {
         qDebug() << "Called the C++ slot";
     }
 };
\endcode

If an instance of \c MessageBoard was set as the context data for a file \c
MyItem.qml, as shown below left, then \c MyItem.qml could invoke the two
methods, as shown below right:

\table
\row
\li C++
\li
\code
 int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
     QGuiApplication app(argc, argv);

     MessageBoard msgBoard;
     QQuickView view;
     view.engine()->rootContext()->setContextProperty("msgBoard", &msgBoard);
     view.setSource(QUrl::fromLocalFile("MyItem.qml"));
     view.show();

     return app.exec();
 }
\endcode
\row
\li QML
\li
\qml
// MyItem.qml
import QtQuick 2.0

Item {
    width: 100; height: 100

    MouseArea {
        anchors.fill: parent
        onClicked: {
            var result = msgBoard.postMessage("Hello from QML")
            console.log("Result of postMessage():", result)
            msgBoard.refresh();
        }
    }
}
\endqml
\endtable

If a C++ method has a parameter with a \c QObject* type, the parameter value
can be passed from QML using an object \c id or a JavaScript \l var value
that references the object.

QML supports the calling of overloaded C++ functions. If there are multiple C++
functions with the same name but different arguments, the correct function will
be called according to the number and the types of arguments that are provided.

Values returned from C++ methods are converted to JavaScript values when
accessed from JavaScript expressions in QML.


\section1 Exposing Signals

Any public \l{Signals & Slots}{signal} of a QObject-derived type is accessible
from QML code.

The QML engine automatically creates a \l{Signal and Handler Event
System}{signal handler} for any signal of a QObject-derived type that is used
from QML. Signal handlers are always named \e on<Signal> where \c <Signal> is
the name of the signal, with the first letter capitalized. All parameters passed
by the signal are available in the signal handler through the parameter names.

For example, suppose the \c MessageBoard class has a \c newMessagePosted()
signal with a single parameter, \c subject:

\code
 class MessageBoard : public QObject
 {
     Q_OBJECT
 public:
    // ...
 signals:
    void newMessagePosted(const QString &subject);
 };
\endcode

If the \c MessageBoard type was \l{Registering C++ types with the QML type
system}{registered} with the QML type system, then a \c MessageBoard object
declared in QML could receive the \c newMessagePosted() signal using a signal
handler named \c onNewMessagePosted, and examine the \c subject parameter
value:

\qml
MessageBoard {
    onNewMessagePosted: console.log("New message received:", subject)
}
\endqml

As with property values and method parameters, a signal parameter must have a
type that is supported by the QML engine; see
\l {Data Type Conversion Between QML and C++}. (Using an
unregistered type will not generate an error, but the parameter value will
not be accessible from the handler.)

Classes may have multiple signals with the same name, but only the final
signal is accessible as a QML signal. Note that signals with the same name
but different parameters cannot be distinguished from one another.

    \title Qt Quick Controls 2 - Text Editor
    \ingroup qtquickcontrols2-examples
    \brief A QML app using Qt Quick Controls 2 and a C++ class to
    provide a fully-functional rich-text editor application.

    The \e {Text Editor Example} presents a sample HTML file using the TextArea
    control, preserving the HTML formatting. The application comes with two user
    interfaces; one for traditional desktop platforms with a mouse pointer, and
    another simpler, touch-oriented version.

    \section1 Desktop User Interface

    The desktop version is a complete text editor with capabilities for formatting
    text, and opening and saving HTML and plain text files. It demonstrates the
    native-looking dialogs and menus using the \l{Qt Labs Platform} module. These
    types are mostly suitable for desktop platforms with support for multiple
    top-level windows, a mouse pointer, and moderate screen size.

    The desktop UI uses FileDialog for opening and saving files:

    \quotefromfile texteditor/qml/texteditor.qml
    \skipto FileDialog
    \printuntil /\bsaveAs\b/
    \printline }

    It uses FontDialog and ColorDialog for choosing fonts and colors:

    \skipto FontDialog
    \printuntil /.*colorDialog$/
    \printuntil /^\s{4}\}$/

    It also uses \l[QML QtLabsPlatform]{Menu} and
    \l[QML QtLabsPlatform]{MenuItem} that provide a context menu to format text
    within:

    \skipto /\bMenu\b/
    \printuntil /^\s{4}\}$/

    \note There is also a standard menubar with more options than the
    context menu.

    \section1 Touch User Interface

    The touch user interface is a simplified version of the text editor. It is
    suitable for touch devices with limited screen size. The example uses
    \l{Using File Selectors with Qt Quick Controls 2}{file selectors} to load
    the appropriate user interface automatically.

    Unlike the desktop version, which uses top-level dialogs, the touch version
    uses the QML \l Dialog type, which is not a top-level window. This type of
    dialog is fully supported on mobile and embedded platforms that do not support
    multiple top-level windows.

    \quotefromfile texteditor/qml/+touch/texteditor.qml
    \skipto /\bDialog\b/
    \printuntil /^\s{4}\}$/

    \section1 C++ Backend

    Both user interfaces use the same C++ backend, which supports opening, formatting,
    and editing a document. The C++ class, \c DocumentHandler, extends QObject and is
    registered as a QML type under the namespace \c {io.qt.examples.texteditor 1.0}.

    The following snippets show how the type is registered under a namespace and later
    imported and instantiated by \e main.qml. For more information about registering C++
    classes as QML types, see \l {Defining QML Types from C++}.

    QML type registration:

    \code
    #include <QtQml/qqml.h>
    ...
    qmlRegisterType<DocumentHandler>("io.qt.examples.texteditor", 1, 0, "DocumentHandler");
    ...
    \endcode

    QML namespace import:

    \code
    import io.qt.examples.texteditor 1.0
    \endcode

    QML instance:

    \quotefromfile texteditor/qml/texteditor.qml
    \skipto DocumentHandler
    \printuntil /^\s{4}\}$/

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \title Qt Quick Controls 2 - Contact List
    \ingroup qtquickcontrols2-examples
    \brief A QML app using Qt Quick Controls 2 and a C++ class that implements
    a simple contact list.

    The \e {Contact List Example} shows how to integrate a C++ backend in a way that
    is compatible with Qt Quick Designer.
    For the declarative parts of the UI, .ui.qml files are used that can be edited
    visually in the Qt Quick Designer.

    \section1 C++ Backend

    The contact list application allows the user to add, edit, and remove contacts.
    The actual implementation is done in C++ and exposed as a QAbstractListModel.

    The ContactModel C++ class is registered under a namespace and later
    imported and instantiated by \e MainForm.ui.qml. For more information about registering C++
    classes as QML types, see \l {Defining QML Types from C++}.

    \code
    #include <QtQml/qqml.h>
    ...
    qmlRegisterType<ContactModel>("Backend", 1, 0, "ContactModel");
    ...
    \endcode

    \section1 Designer Support

    In the designer subdirectory, we create a plugin that replaces the ContactModel
    in Qt Quick Designer. For this to work we add the following line to \e contactlist.pro.

    \code
    QML_DESIGNER_IMPORT_PATH = $$PWD/designer
    \endcode

    Because Qt Quick Designer cannot instantiate the ContactModel C++ class, we define
    a mockup using a ListModel. This ensures that the ListView using the model shows something
    in Qt Quick Designer.

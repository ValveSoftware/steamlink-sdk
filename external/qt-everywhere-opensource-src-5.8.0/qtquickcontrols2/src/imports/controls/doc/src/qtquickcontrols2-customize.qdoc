    \title Customizing Qt Quick Controls 2
    \brief A set of UI controls to create user interfaces in Qt Quick

    Qt Quick Controls 2 consist of a hierarchy (tree) of items. In order to
    provide a custom look and feel, the default QML implementation of each
    item can be replaced with a custom one.

    \section1 Customizing a Control

    Sometimes you'll want to create a "one-off" look for a specific part of
    your UI, and use a complete style everywhere else. Perhaps you're happy
    with the style you're using, but there's a certain button that has some
    special significance.

    The first way to create this button is to simply define it in-place,
    wherever it is needed. For example, perhaps you're not satisfied with the
    default style's Button having square corners. To make them rounded, you
    can override the \l {Control::}{background} item and set the radius
    property of Rectangle:

    \qml
    import QtQuick 2.6
    import QtQuick.Controls 2.1

    ApplicationWindow {
        width: 400
        height: 400
        visible: true

        Button {
            id: button
            text: "A Special Button"
            background: Rectangle {
                implicitWidth: 100
                implicitHeight: 40
                color: button.down ? "#d6d6d6" : "#f6f6f6"
                border.color: "#26282a"
                border.width: 1
                radius: 4
            }
        }
    }
    \endqml

    The second way to create the button is good if you plan to use your rounded
    button in several places. It involves moving the code into its own QML file
    within your project.

    For this approach, we'll copy the background code from the default style's
    \c Button.qml. This file can be found in the following path in your Qt
    installation:

    \c {$QTDIR/qml/QtQuick/Controls.2/Button.qml}

    After doing that, we'll simply add the following line:

    \code
    radius: 4
    \endcode

    To avoid confusion with the controls in the
    module itself, we'll call the file \c MyButton.qml. To use the control in
    your application, refer to it by its filename:

    \qml
    import QtQuick.Controls 2.1

    ApplicationWindow {
        MyButton {
            text: qsTr("A Special Button")
        }
    }
    \endqml

    The third way to create the button is a bit more structured, both in terms
    of where the file sits in the file system and how it is used in QML. First,
    copy an existing file as you did above, but this time, put it into a
    subfolder in your project named (for example) \c controls. To use the
    control, first import the folder into a namespace:

    \qml
    import QtQuick.Controls 2.1
    import "controls" as MyControls

    ApplicationWindow {
        MyControls.Button {
            text: qsTr("A Special Button")
        }
    }
    \endqml

    As you now have the \c MyControls namespace, you can name the controls after
    their actual counterparts in the Qt Quick Controls 2 module. You can repeat
    this process for any control that you wish to add.

    \section1 Creating a Custom Style

    There are several ways to go about creating your own styles. Below, we'll
    explain the various approaches.

    \section2 Definition of a Style

    In Qt Quick Controls 2, a style is essentially an interchangeable set of
    QML files within a single directory. There are two requirements for a style
    to be \l {Using Styles in Qt Quick Controls 2}{usable}:

    \list
    \li At least one QML file whose name matches a control (for example,
        \c Button.qml) must exist.
    \li The files must be in a directory in the filesystem or in the
        \l {The Qt Resource System}{resource system}.

        For example, these are all valid paths to a style:

        \list
        \li \c {./myapp -style /home/absolute/path/to/my/style}
        \li \c {./myapp -style :/mystyle}
        \li \c {./myapp -style relative/path/to/my/style}
        \li \c {./myapp -style MyStyle}
        \endlist

        The third and fourth paths will be looked up within the QML engine's import path
        list. This is the same as what happens when you pass \c Material as the style,
        for example.
    \endlist

    By default, the styling system uses the Default style as a fallback for
    controls that aren't implemented. To customize or extend any other built-in
    style, it is possible to specify a different fallback style using \l QQuickStyle.

    What this means is that you can implement as many controls as you like for
    your custom style, and place them almost anywhere. It also allows users to
    create their own styles for your application.

    \section2 Style-specific C++ Extensions

    Sometimes you may need to use C++ to extend your custom style. There are two
    ways to expose such types to QML:

    \list
    \li If the style that uses the type is the only style used by an application,
        it's enough to register it with the QML engine via qmlRegisterType():

        \code
        qmlRegisterType<ACoolCppItem>("MyApp", 1, 0, "ACoolItem");
        \endcode

        See \l {Using C++ Data From QML} for more information about this.
    \li If the style that uses the type is one of many styles used by an
        application, it may be better to only register it when necessary. This
        is the point at which it would make sense to implement your own
        \l {Creating C++ Plugins for QML}{QML plugin}.

        Using a plugin as part of your style is not that much different from
        using a set of QML files. The only difference is that the plugin and
        its \c qmldir file must be present in the same directory as the QML
        files.
    \endlist

    \section3 Attached properties

    It is common for a style to have certain properties or attributes that
    apply to all controls. \l {Attached Properties and Attached Signal
    Handlers}{Attached properties} are a great way of extending an item in QML
    without having to modify any existing C++ belonging to that item. For
    example, both the \l {Material Style}{Material} and \l {Universal
    Style}{Universal} styles have an attached theme property that controls
    whether an item and its children will be rendered in a light or dark theme.

    As an example, let's add an attached property that controls elevation. Our
    style will illustrate the elevation with a drop shadow; the higher the
    elevation, the larger the shadow.

    The first step is to add a C++ type that stores the elevation. Since the
    type will be used for every control supported by our style, and because we
    may wish to add other attached properties later on, we'll call it
    MyStyle. Here is \c MyStyle.h:

    \code
    #ifndef MYSTYLE_H
    #define MYSTYLE_H

    #include <QObject>
    #include <QtQml>

    class MyStyle : public QObject
    {
        Q_OBJECT
        Q_PROPERTY(int elevation READ elevation WRITE setElevation NOTIFY elevationChanged)

    public:
        explicit MyStyle(QObject *parent = nullptr);

        static MyStyle *qmlAttachedProperties(QObject *object);

        int elevation() const;
        void setElevation(int elevation);

    signals:
        void elevationChanged();

    private:
        int m_elevation;
    };

    QML_DECLARE_TYPEINFO(MyStyle, QML_HAS_ATTACHED_PROPERTIES)

    #endif // MYSTYLE_H
    \endcode

    \c MyStyle.cpp:

    \code
    #include "mystyle.h"

    MyStyle::MyStyle(QObject *parent) :
        QObject(parent),
        m_elevation(0)
    {
    }

    MyStyle *MyStyle::qmlAttachedProperties(QObject *object)
    {
        return new MyStyle(object);
    }

    int MyStyle::elevation() const
    {
        return m_elevation;
    }

    void MyStyle::setElevation(int elevation)
    {
        if (elevation == m_elevation)
            return;

        m_elevation = elevation;
        emit elevationChanged();
    }
    \endcode

    The \c MyStyle type is special in the sense that it shouldn't be
    instantiated, but rather used for its attached properties. For that reason,
    we register it in the following manner:

    \code
    qmlRegisterUncreatableType<MyStyle>("MyStyle", 1, 0, "MyStyle", "MyStyle is an attached property");
    \endcode

    We then copy the existing default Button style, and add the code for a drop
    shadow (which was taken from the Material Button style). We modify that
    slightly to ensure that we:

    \list
    \li Don't bother using the drop shadow when the elevation is \c 0
    \li Change the shadow's color depending on whether or not the button has
        focus
    \li Make the size of the shadow depend on the elevation
    \endlist

    \code
        layer.enabled: control.enabled && control.MyStyle.elevation > 0
        layer.effect: DropShadow {
            verticalOffset: 1
            color: control.visualFocus ? "#330066ff" : "#aaaaaa"
            samples: control.MyStyle.elevation
            spread: 0.5
        }
    \endcode

    With that in place, we can try out our new elevation feature:

    \qml
    import QtQuick 2.6
    import QtQuick.Controls 2.1

    import MyStyle 1.0

    ApplicationWindow {
        id: window
        width: 400
        height: 400
        visible: true

        Row {
            spacing: 20
            anchors.centerIn: parent

            Button {
                text: "Button 1"
            }
            Button {
                text: "Button 2"
                MyStyle.elevation: 10
            }
        }
    }
    \endqml

    The end result:

    \section1 Customization Reference

    The following snippets present examples where the default style's controls

    \brief Guidelines for input controls

    Qt Quick Controls 2 offers a variety of input controls for both numeric
    and textual input.

    \annotatedlist qtquickcontrols2-input

    Each type of input control has its own specific target use case. The
    following sections offer guidelines for choosing the appropriate type
    of input control, depending on the use case.

    \section1 ComboBox Control

    \image qtquickcontrols2-combobox.gif

    \l ComboBox is used to select a value from a static multiple-line drop-down list.
    It is not possible to add new values, and only one option can be selected.

    Recommendations:
    \list
    \li If the number of values is very large, consider applying a filter.
    \li If the list is very limited, consider using RadioButton. This has the
    advantage that the user can see all options at the same time.
    \li Select a default value, the value that will be chosen most often.
    \endlist

    \b {See also} \l {CheckBox Control}, \l {Tumbler Control}.

    \section1 Dial Control

    as stereos or industrial equipment.

    The dial is rotated by clicking and dragging, with the handle indicating the
    value of the dial.

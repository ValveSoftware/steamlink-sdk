    \image qtquickcontrols2-menu.png

    \l Menu control can be used for context menus; for example, after
    right-clicking. It can also be used for popup menus; for example, a
    menu that is shown after clicking a button.

   \l MenuItem is an item in the Menu control. Each item in a menu:
   \list
   \li displays text to the user
   \li allows checking/unchecking
   \li is highlighted (for example, on keyboard navigation)
   \li performs some action on activation
   \endlist

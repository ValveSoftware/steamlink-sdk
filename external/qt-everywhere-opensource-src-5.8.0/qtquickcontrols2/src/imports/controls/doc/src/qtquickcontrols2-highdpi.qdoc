    \title High-DPI Support in Qt Quick Controls 2

    Qt Quick Controls 2 support Qt's cross-platform high-DPI scaling introduced in Qt 5.6.
    The feature is opt-in, and can be enabled by setting the \c Qt::AA_EnableHighDpiScaling
    application attribute in C++ before QGuiApplication is constructed:

    \code
    #include <QGuiApplication>
    #include <QQmlApplicationEngine>

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
        QGuiApplication::setAttribute(Qt::AA_EnableHighDpiScaling); // <--
        QGuiApplication app(argc, argv);
        QQmlApplicationEngine engine;
        engine.load(QUrl(QStringLiteral("qrc:/main.qml")));
        return app.exec();
    }
    \endcode

    Alternatively, an environment variable \c QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=1 can be set
    to enable automatic high-DPI scaling.

    \warning \l {Qt Quick Controls}{Qt Quick Controls 1.x} are not compatible with Qt's
    automatic high-DPI scaling. There is currently no available solution for high-DPI
    support in applications wishing to mix Qt Quick Controls and Qt Quick Controls 2.

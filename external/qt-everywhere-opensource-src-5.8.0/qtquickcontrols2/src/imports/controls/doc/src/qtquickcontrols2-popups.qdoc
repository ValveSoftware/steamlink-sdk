    \brief Guidelines for popup controls

    \annotatedlist qtquickcontrols2-popups

    Each type of popup control has its own specific target use case. The
    following sections offer guidelines for choosing the appropriate type
    of popup control, depending on the use case.

    \section1 Drawer Control

    \l Drawer provides a swipe-based side panel, similar to those often used
    in touch interfaces to provide a central location for navigation.

    The drawer can be positioned at any of the four edges of the screen. It allows
    the user to add navigation without taking up valuable screen space. The user can
    show and hide the drawer at any time with a simple swipe movement.

    \section1 Menu Control

    The \l Menu control displays a vertical list of items that can be selected. It can
    be used for offering a list of actions that can be taken in a given context.

    \b {See also} \l {Drawer Control}.

    \section1 Popup Control

    \image qtquickcontrols2-popup-settings.png

    A \l Popup displays content over other application content.
    It prompts the user to make a decision or enter information.

    Popups can be modal or non-modal. A modal popup blocks users from interacting
    with the application until they have made a choice and closed the popup.

    A popup can be used for:

    \list
    \li communicating a message to the user that he must read and acknowledge.
    \li displaying an error message.
    \li prompting the user to make a choice and/or enter a value.
    \endlist

    \section1 ToolTip Control

    \l ToolTip shows a short piece of text that informs the user of a control's
    function. It is typically placed above or below the parent control.

    Recommendations:
    \list
    \li Use a tooltip if a control has little or no descriptive text, or needs
    a short explanation.
    \li Use a tooltip only if the information on a particular control is not
     available elsewhere in the screen.
    \li Keep the tooltip text short so that it does not cover other content
    while being displayed.
    \endlist

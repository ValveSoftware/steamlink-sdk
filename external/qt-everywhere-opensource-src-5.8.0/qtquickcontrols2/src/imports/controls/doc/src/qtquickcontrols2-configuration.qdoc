    \title Qt Quick Controls 2 Configuration File

    Qt Quick Controls 2 support a special configuration file, \c :/qtquickcontrols2.conf,
    that is built into an application's resources.

    The configuration file can specify the preferred style and certain style-specific
    attributes. The following example specifies that the preferred style is the \l {Material style}.
    Furthermore, when the application is run with the Material style, its theme is light and the
    accent and primary colors are teal and blue grey, respectively. However, if the application
    is run with the \l {Universal style} instead, the accent color is red and the appropriate theme
    is chosen based on the system theme colors.

    \code
    [Controls]
    Style=Material

    [Universal]
    Theme=System
    Accent=Red

    [Material]
    Theme=Light
    Accent=Teal
    Primary=BlueGrey
    \endcode

    \l {Material style} specific values that can be specified in a \c Material
    section of the configuration file:

    \include qquickmaterialstyle.qdocinc conf

    \l {Universal style} specific values that can be specified in a \c Universal
    section of the configuration file:

    \include qquickuniversalstyle.qdocinc conf

    In order to make it possible for Qt Quick Controls 2 to find the configuration file,
    it must be built into application's resources using the \l {The Qt Resource System}.
    Here's an example \c .qrc file:

    \code
    <!DOCTYPE RCC><RCC version="1.0">
    <qresource prefix="/">
        <file>qtquickcontrols2.conf</file>
    </qresource>
    </RCC>
    \endcode

    \note Qt Quick Controls 2 uses a file selector to load the configuration file. It
    is possible to provide a different configuration file for different platforms and
    locales. See \l QFileSelector documentation for more details.

    Finally, the \c .qrc file must be listed in the application's \c .pro file so that
    the build system knows about it. For example:

    \code
    RESOURCES = application.qrc
    \endcode

  \title Qt WebView
  \brief A light-weight web view.

  Qt WebView provides a way to display web content in a QML application without
  necessarily including a full web browser stack by using native APIs where
  it makes sense.

  This is useful on mobile platforms such as \l {Qt for Android}{Android},
  \l {Qt for iOS}{iOS}, and \l {Qt for WinRT}{WinRT}; especially
  on iOS, where policy dictates that all web content is displayed using the
  operating system's web view.

  \section1 Prerequisites

  To make the Qt WebView module function correctly across all platforms, it's necessary
  to call \l {qtwebview-initialize}{QtWebView::initialize}() right after creating the
  QGuiApplication instance.

  \section1 QML Types

  The module provides a single QML component for displaying web content in
  the application: \l{WebView}.

  \section1 Limitations

  Due to platform limitations, overlapping the WebView with other QML components
  is not supported. Doing this will have unpredictable results which may differ
  from platform to platform.

  \section1 Examples

  Take a look at the \l{Qt WebView Examples} for a demonstration on
  how the APIs can be used in applications.

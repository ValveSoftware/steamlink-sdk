// Implemented by something "known to" the Mojo Shell (e.g. an application or
// service), for which an instance is tracked. It allows the implementor to
// receive lifecycle events and service inbound connection attempts.
interface ShellClient {
  // Called by the shell once an instance for this application has been created.
  // This method will be called exactly once before any other method is called.
  //
  // Parameters:
  //
  //  identity
  //    The identity of this instance in the shell. Includes:
  //    * The resolved name used in the connection request that resulted in this
  //      instance being initialized.
  //    * The user associated with this instance in the shell. This will never
  //      be kInheritUserID.
  //    * The instance group this instance belongs to.
  //
  //  id
  //    A unique identifier used by the shell to identify this instance.
  //
  //
  // Response parameters:
  //
  //  connector_request
  //    An optional Connector request for the shell to bind, allowing the
  //    initialized client to connect to others.
  //
  Initialize(Identity identity, uint32 id) => (Connector&? connector_request);

  // Called when another application attempts to open a connection to this
  // application. An application implements this method to complete the exchange
  // of interface implementations with the remote application. See also
  // documentation in shell.mojom for Connect(). The application originating
  // the request is referred to as the "source" and the one receiving the
  // "target".
  //
  // Parameters:
  //
  //  source
  //    The identity of the instance originating the connection.
  //
  //  source_id
  //    A unique identifier used by the shell to identify the source instance.
  //
  //  local_interfaces
  //    A request for an InterfaceProvider by which the source application may
  //    seek to bind interface implementations exported by the target.
  //
  //  remote_interfaces
  //    An InterfaceProvider by which the target application may bind interface
  //    implementations exported by the source.
  //
  //  allowed_interfaces
  //    A whitelist of interface names that should be exported to the source,
  //    according to the security policy described by the source and target's
  //    manifests. Attempts to bind interfaces not in this whitelist must not be
  //    fulfilled.
  //
  //  resolved_name
  //    The resolved name used to complete this connection.
  //

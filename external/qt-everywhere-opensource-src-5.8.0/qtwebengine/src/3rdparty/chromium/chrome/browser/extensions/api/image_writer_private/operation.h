// Encapsulates an operation being run on behalf of the
// OperationManager.  Construction of the operation does not start
// anything.  The operation's Start method should be called to start it, and
// then the Cancel method will stop it.  The operation will call back to the
// OperationManager periodically or on any significant event.
//
// Each stage of the operation is generally divided into three phases: Start,
// Run, Complete.  Start and Complete run on the UI thread and are responsible
// for advancing to the next stage and other UI interaction.  The Run phase does
// the work on the FILE thread and calls SendProgress or Error as appropriate.
//
// TODO(haven): This class is current refcounted because it is owned by the
// OperationManager on the UI thread but needs to do work on the FILE thread.
// There is probably a better way to organize this so that it can be represented
// by a WeakPtr, but those are not thread-safe.  Additionally, if destruction is
// done on the UI thread then that causes problems if any of the fields were
// allocated/accessed on the FILE thread.  http://crbug.com/344713

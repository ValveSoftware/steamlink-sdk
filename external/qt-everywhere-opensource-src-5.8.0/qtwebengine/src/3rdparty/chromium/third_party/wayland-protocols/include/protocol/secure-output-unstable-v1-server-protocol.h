/**
 * @page page_secure_output_unstable_v1 The secure_output_unstable_v1 protocol
 * Protocol for providing secure output
 *
 * @section page_desc_secure_output_unstable_v1 Description
 *
 * This protocol specifies a set of interfaces used to prevent surface
 * contents from appearing in screenshots or from being visible on non-secure
 * outputs.
 *
 * In order to prevent surface contents from appearing in screenshots or from
 * being visible on non-secure outputs, a client must first bind the global
 * interface "wp_secure_output" which, if a compositor supports secure output,
 * is exposed by the registry. Using the bound global object, the client uses
 * the "get_security" request to instantiate an interface extension for a
 * wl_surface object. This extended interface will then allow surfaces
 * to be marked as only visible on secure outputs.
 *
 * Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and backward
 * incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes may be added
 * together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward
 * incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in the protocol
 * and interface names and resetting the interface version. Once the protocol
 * is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the version number in the
 * protocol and interface names are removed and the interface version number is
 * reset.

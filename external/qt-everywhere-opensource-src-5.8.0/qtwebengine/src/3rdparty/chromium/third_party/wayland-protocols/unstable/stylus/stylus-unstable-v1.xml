  <interface name="zwp_stylus_v1" version="1">
    <description summary="extends wl_pointer with events for on-screen stylus">
      Allows a wl_pointer to represent an on-screen stylus. The client can
      interpret the on-screen stylus like any other mouse device, and use
      this protocol to obtain detail information about the type of stylus,
      as well as the force and tilt of the tool.

      These events are to be fired by the server within the same frame as other
      wl_pointer events.

      Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and
      backward incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes
      may be added together with the corresponding uinterface version bump.
      Backward incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in
      the protocol and uinterface names and resetting the interface version.
      Once the protocol is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the
      version number in the protocol and interface names are removed and the
      interface version number is reset.

        If this event is not received, the client has to assume a mouse is in
        use. The remaining events of this protocol are only being generated

        mouse, this event will also be generated.

        The force is calibrated and normalized to the 0 to 1 range.

        Measured from surface normal as plane angle in degrees, values lie in
        [-90,90]. A positive x is to the right and a positive y is towards the

    Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and backward
    incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes may be added
    together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward
    incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in the protocol
    and interface names and resetting the interface version. Once the protocol
    is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the version number in the
    protocol and interface names are removed and the interface version number is
    reset.

      An interface that may be implemented by a wl_surface, for

      and allows for remotely managed windows.

      It provides requests to treat surfaces like windows, allowing to set
      properties like app id and geometry.

      The client must call wl_surface.commit on the corresponding wl_surface
      for the remote_surface state to take effect.

      For a surface to be mapped by the compositor the client must have
      committed both an remote_surface state and a buffer.

	Once the window geometry of the surface is set once, it is not

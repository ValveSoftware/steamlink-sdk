 * Protocol for more advanced compositing and blending
 *
 * @section page_desc_alpha_compositing_unstable_v1 Description
 *
 * This protocol specifies a set of interfaces used to control the alpha
 * compositing and blending of contents.
 *
 * Warning! The protocol described in this file is experimental and backward
 * incompatible changes may be made. Backward compatible changes may be added
 * together with the corresponding interface version bump. Backward
 * incompatible changes are done by bumping the version number in the protocol
 * and interface names and resetting the interface version. Once the protocol
 * is to be declared stable, the 'z' prefix and the version number in the
 * protocol and interface names are removed and the interface version number is
 * reset.

# Owner approval for 3rd party is only required for

# new third party libraries.

#
# For changes to existing code that has no OWNER file, simply TBR= one of
# people below in addition to getting an appropriate code review. Generally
# third_party modules should have owners, so if you find yourself doing this
# more than once or twice for a directory, consider adding an OWNER file. If
# you're making changes and there isn't a more obvious person, the owner is
# probably you!

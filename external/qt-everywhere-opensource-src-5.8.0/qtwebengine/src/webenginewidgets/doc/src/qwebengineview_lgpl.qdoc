    \class QWebEngineView
    \brief The QWebEngineView class provides a widget that is used to view and edit
    web documents.
    \since 5.4
    \ingroup advanced

    \inmodule QtWebEngineWidgets

    A \e {web view} is the main widget component of the Qt WebEngine web browsing module.
    It can be used in various applications to display web content live from the
    Internet.

    A \e {web site} can be loaded to a web view with the load() function. The
    GET method is always used to load URLs.

    Like all Qt widgets, the show() function must be invoked in order to display
    the web view. The snippet below illustrates this:

    \snippet simple/main.cpp Using QWebEngineView

    Alternatively, setUrl() can be used to load a web site. If you have
    the HTML content readily available, you can use setHtml() instead.

    The loadStarted() signal is emitted when the view begins loading and the loadProgress()
    signal is emitted whenever an element of the web view completes loading, such as an embedded
    image or a script. The loadFinished() signal is emitted when the view has been loaded
    completely. Its argument, either \c true or \c false, indicates whether loading was
    successful or failed.

    The page() function returns a pointer to a \e {web page} object. A QWebEngineView contains a
    QWebEnginePage, which in turn allows access to the QWebEngineHistory in the page's context.

    The title of an HTML document can be accessed with the title() property.
    Additionally, a web site may specify an icon, which can be accessed
    using the icon() or its URL using the iconUrl() property.
    If the title or the icon changes, the corresponding titleChanged(), iconChanged()
    and iconUrlChanged() signals will be emitted.
    The zoomFactor() property enables zooming the contents of the web page by a
    scale factor.

    The widget features a context menu that is tailored to the element at
    hand, and includes actions useful in a browser. For a custom context menu,
    or for embedding actions in a menu or toolbar, the individual actions are available
    via \l pageAction(). The web view maintains the state of the returned actions,
    but allows modification of action properties such as \l{QAction::}{text} or
    \l{QAction::}{icon}. The action semantics can also be triggered directly through
    triggerPageAction().

    If you want to provide support for web sites that allow the user to open
    new windows, such as pop-up windows, you can subclass QWebEngineView and
    reimplement the createWindow() function.

    Makes \a page the new web page of the web view.

    view, it will be deleted.

/*!
    \fn void QWebEngineView::setHtml(const QString &html, const QUrl &baseUrl)
    Sets the content of the web view to the specified \a html content.

    External objects, such as stylesheets or images referenced in the HTML
    document, are located relative to \a baseUrl.

    The HTML document is loaded immediately, whereas external objects are loaded asynchronously.

    When using this method, Qt WebEngine assumes that external resources, such as
    JavaScript programs or style sheets, are encoded in UTF-8 unless otherwise
    specified. For example, the encoding of an external script can be specified
    through the \c charset attribute of the HTML script tag. Alternatively, the
    encoding can be specified by the web server.

    This is a convenience function equivalent to
    \c{setContent(html, "text/html;charset=UTF-8", baseUrl)}.

    \warning This function works only for HTML. For other MIME types (such as XHTML or SVG),
    setContent() should be used instead.

/*!
    \fn void QWebEngineView::setContent(const QByteArray &data, const QString &mimeType, const QUrl &baseUrl)
    Sets the content of the web view to the specified content \a data. If the \a mimeType argument
    is empty, it is currently assumed that the content is HTML but in future versions we may
    introduce auto-detection.

    External objects referenced in the content are located relative to \a baseUrl.

    The data is loaded immediately; external objects are loaded asynchronously.

    \class QWebEnginePage
    \brief The QWebEnginePage class provides an object to view and edit web documents.
    \since 5.4
    \inmodule QtWebEngineWidgets

    A \e {web engine page} holds the contents of an HTML document, the history of navigated
    links, and actions.

    QWebEnginePage's API is very similar to QWebEngineView, as you are still provided with
    common functions like action() (known as
    \l{QWebEngineView::pageAction()}{pageAction}() in QWebEngineView), triggerAction(),
    and findText().

    A page can be loaded using load() or setUrl(). Alternatively, if you have
    the HTML content readily available, you can use setHtml(). The GET method is
    always used to load URLs.

    The QWebEnginePage class also offers methods to retrieve both the URL currently
    loaded by the page (see url()) as well as the URL originally requested
    to be loaded (see requestedUrl()). These methods make possible the retrieval
    of the URL before and after a DNS resolution or a redirection occurs during
    the load process. The requestedUrl() also matches to the URL added to the
    page history (\l{QWebEngineHistory}) if load is successful.

    The title of an HTML page can be accessed with the title() property.
    Additionally, a page may also specify an icon, which can be accessed
    using the icon() or its URL using the iconUrl() property.
    If the title or the icon changes, the corresponding titleChanged(), iconChanged()
    and iconUrlChanged() signals will be emitted.
    The zoomFactor() property enables zooming the contents of the web page by a
    scale factor.

    The loadStarted() signal is emitted when the page begins to load, whereas the loadProgress()
    signal is emitted whenever an element of the web page completes loading, such as an embedded
    image or a script. The loadFinished() signal is emitted when the page contents
    have been loaded completely, independent of script execution or page rendering.
    Its argument, either \c true or \c false, indicates whether or not the load
    operation succeeded.

    An HTML document is loaded in a \e {main frame} within the web page. If it references
    \e {child frames} (as defined by the \c  <frame> or \c <iframe> elements), they are considered
    part of the content. Child frames are individually accessible only through JavaScript.

    Web sites define \e {security origin} for safely accessing each other's resources for
    client-side scripting or databases. An origin consist of a host name, a scheme, and a port
    number. For example, the sites \c http://www.example.com/my/page.html and
    \c http://www.example.com/my/overview.html are allowed to share the same database or access
    each other's documents when used in HTML frame sets and JavaScript. At the same time,
    \c http://www.malicious.com/evil.html is prevented from accessing the resources of
    \c http://www.example.com/, because they are of a different security origin.
    By default, local schemes like \c file:// and \c qrc:// are considered to be in the same
    security origin, and can access each other's resources. Local resources are by default
    restricted from accessing remote content, which means that \c file:// will not be able to
    access \c http://domain.com/foo.html.

    Scripts can be executed on the web page by using runJavaScript(), either in the main
    JavaScript \e world, along with the rest of the JavaScript coming from the web contents, or in
    their own isolated world. While the DOM of the page can be accessed from any world, JavaScript
    variables of a function defined in one world are not accessible from a different one.
    QWebEngineScript::ScriptWorldId provides some predefined IDs for this purpose. Using the
    \c runJavaScript() version without the world ID is the same as running the script in the
    \c MainWorld.

    The \l {QWebEngineSettings::FocusOnNavigationEnabled} {FocusOnNavigationEnabled} setting can be
    used to stop the view associated with the page from automatically receiving focus when a
    navigation operation occurs (like loading or reloading a page or navigating through history).

   This enum describes the options available to the findText() function. The options
   can be OR-ed together from the following list:

   \value FindBackward Searches backwards instead of forwards.

/*!
    \fn void QWebEnginePage::javaScriptConsoleMessage(JavaScriptConsoleMessageLevel level, const QString& message, int lineNumber, const QString& sourceID)
    This function is called when a JavaScript program tries to print the \a message to the web
    browser's console.

    For example, in case of evaluation errors the source URL may be provided in \a sourceID as well
    as the \a lineNumber.

    \a level indicates the severity of the event that triggered the message. That is, whether it
    was triggered by an error or a less severe event.

    Since Qt 5.6, the default implementation logs the messages in a \c js
    \l{QLoggingCategory}{logging category}.

*/

/*!
    \fn bool acceptNavigationRequest(const QUrl &url, NavigationType type, bool isMainFrame)
    \since 5.5
    This function is called upon receiving a request to navigate to the specified \a url by means of
    the specified navigation type \a type. \a isMainFrame indicates whether the request corresponds
    to the main frame or a child frame. If the function returns \c true, the navigation request is
    accepted and \c url is loaded. The default implementation accepts all navigation requests.

    This function is called for absolute URLs that are prefixed with \c {http://} or \c {https://}
    and for unrecognized schemes, such as \c {mailto:}, which will be handled by QDesktopServices
    if accepted. To have this function called also upon receiving navigation requests to local URLs,
    prefix the URLs with \c {http://}.

    Navigation requests can be delegated to the Qt application instead of having the HTML handler
    engine process them by overloading this function. This is necessary when an HTML document is
    used as part of the user interface, and not to display external data, for example, when
    displaying a list of results.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QWebEnginePage::javaScriptAlert(const QUrl &securityOrigin, const QString& msg)
    This function is called whenever a JavaScript program running in a frame affiliated with

    The default implementation shows the message, \a msg, with QMessageBox::information.
*/

/*!
    \fn bool QWebEnginePage::javaScriptConfirm(const QUrl &securityOrigin, const QString& msg)
    This function is called whenever a JavaScript program running in a frame affiliated with
    \a securityOrigin calls the \c confirm() function with the message \a msg. Returns \c true
    if the user confirms the message; otherwise returns \c false.

    The default implementation executes the query using QMessageBox::information with QMessageBox::Ok and QMessageBox::Cancel buttons.
*/

/*!
    \fn bool QWebEnginePage::javaScriptPrompt(const QUrl &securityOrigin, const QString& msg, const QString& defaultValue, QString* result)
    This function is called whenever a JavaScript program running in a frame affiliated with \a securityOrigin tries to prompt the user for input.
    The program may provide an optional message, \a msg, as well as a default value for the input in \a defaultValue.

    If the prompt was cancelled by the user, the implementation should return \c false; otherwise the
    result should be written to \a result and \c true should be returned. If the prompt was not
    cancelled by the user, the implementation should return \c true and the result string must not
    be null.

    The default implementation uses QInputDialog::getText().
*/

/*!
    \fn QWebEnginePage *QWebEnginePage::createWindow(WebWindowType type)
    This function is called to create a new window of the specified \a type. For example, when a
    JavaScript program requests to open a document in a new window.

    If the new window can be created, the new window's QWebEnginePage is returned; otherwise a null pointer is returned.

    If the view associated with the web page is a QWebEngineView object, then the default implementation forwards
    the request to QWebEngineView::createWindow(); otherwise it returns a null pointer.

    \note In the cases when the window creation is being triggered by JavaScript, apart from
    reimplementing this method the application must also set

    The \a html is loaded immediately; external objects are loaded asynchronously.

    If a script in the \a html runs longer than the default script timeout (currently 10 seconds),
    for example due to being blocked by a modal JavaScript alert dialog, this method will return
    as soon as possible after the timeout and any subsequent \a html will be loaded asynchronously.

    When using this method, the web engine assumes that external resources, such as JavaScript programs or style
    sheets, are encoded in UTF-8 unless otherwise specified. For example, the encoding of an external
    script can be specified through the charset attribute of the HTML script tag. It is also possible
    for the encoding to be specified by the web server.

    This is a convenience function equivalent to setContent(html, "text/html", baseUrl).

    \e runJavaScript() versions without the world ID is the same as running the script in the
    \c MainWorld.

    When the script has been executed, \a resultCallback is called with the result of the last
    executed statement. \c resultCallback can be any of a function pointer, a functor or a lambda,
    and it is expected to take a QVariant parameter. For example:

    \code
    page.runJavaScript("document.title", [](const QVariant &v) { qDebug() << v.toString(); });
    \endcode

    \warning Do not execute lengthy routines in the callback function, because it might block the
    rendering of the web engine page.

    See scripts() for an alternative API to inject scripts.

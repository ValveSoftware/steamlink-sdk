    \title Qt WebEngine Examples
    \brief Examples demonstrating the Qt WebEngine usage
    \ingroup all-examples

    These examples and demonstrations show a range of different uses for \l{Qt WebEngine},
    from displaying Web pages within a QML user interface to an implementation of
    a basic function Web browser.

    For widget-based applications, Qt provides an integrated Web browser component based on
    Chromium, the popular open source browser engine.

    \qmltype WebEngineView
    \instantiates QQuickWebEngineView
    \inqmlmodule QtWebEngine
    \since QtWebEngine 1.0
    \brief A WebEngineView renders web content within a QML application.

    The WebEngineView type enables QML applications to render regions of dynamic web content. It
    may share the screen with other QML types, such as a TabView, or fill the screen, as specified
    within the QML application.

    \section2 Initializing Web Engine

    For the web engine view to be rendered, the web engine must be initialized by using
    \l QtWebEngine::initialize in the application main source file, as illustrated by the
    following code snippet:

    \quotefromfile webengine/minimal/main.cpp
    \skipto main
    \printuntil }

    \section2 Loading Web Pages

    An application can load pages into the WebEngineView, using either the \l url property or the
    \l loadHtml method and navigate within the view's session history. The GET
    method is always used to load URLs.

    The history is represented by a WebEngineHistory data model that is held by
    the \l navigationHistory property.

    The following sample QML application loads a web page using the \c url property:

    \quotefromfile webengine/minimal/main.qml
    \skipto import
    \printuntil /^\}/

    The \l loading property holds whether an HTML page is currently loading.
    The \l loadingChanged() signal is emitted when loading the page begins, ends, or fails.

    The title of an HTML page can be accessed with the \l title property. Additionally, a web
    page may specify an icon, which can be accessed using the \l icon property. The \l zoomFactor
    property enables zooming the contents of the web page by a scale factor.

    If a certificate error is raised while loading a web page, the \l certificateError() signal is
    emitted. Certificate errors are handled by using the methods of the WebEngineCertificateError
    type.

    \section2 Interaction

    By default, links to different pages load within the same WebEngineView object, but web sites
    may request them to be opened as a new tab, window, or dialog. The \l newViewRequested() signal
    is emitted when a request to load the page in a separate web engine view is issued. The
    NewViewDestination property describes how the new view should be opened. In addition, the
    WebEngineNewViewRequest utility type can be used to load web pages in separate web engine views.

    The \l findText() method can be used to search for a string on a web page, using the options
    described by \l FindFlags.

    The \l setActiveFocusOnPress() method can be used to create a UI element that should not get
    focus on press. This can be useful in a hybrid UI.

    The \l {WebEngineSettings::focusOnNavigationEnabled} {focusOnNavigationEnabled} setting can be
    used to stop the view from automatically receiving focus when a navigation operation occurs
    (like loading or reloading a page or navigating through history).

    The \l linkHovered() signal is emitted when a mouse pointer passes over a link and thus
    corresponds to the \c{mouseover} DOM event.

    Actions, such as selecting and editing content, can be performed on a web page by using the
    \l triggerWebAction() method. The available actions are described by the \l WebAction property.

    The \l backgroundColorChanged() signal is emitted when the web page background color changes.

    \section2 User Scripts

    During the loading of a page, so called \e {user scripts} can be injected in the JavaScript
    engine at different points. The script objects attached to the web engine view are held by the
    \l userScripts property and injected by using the WebEngineScript type. Scripts can also be run
    by using the runJavaScript() method in the same world as other scripts that are part of the
    loaded site.

    The \l webChannel property can be used to expose a WebChannel instance in the JavaScript context
    of the page it is rendering as \c qt.webChannelTransport.

    \section2 Fullscreen Mode

    A web page can request through the JavaScript API to be loaded in fullscreen mode. The
    \l fullScreenRequested() signal is emitted when the web page issues the request. The
    WebEngineFullScreenRequest utility type can be used to toggle fullscreen requests. The
    \l fullScreenCancelled method can be used to notify the browser engine when the windowing
    system forces the application to leave fullscreen mode.

    \section2 Profiles

    Web engine views can be isolated from each other by using the WebEngineProfile type. A profile
    contains settings, scripts, and the list of visited links shared by all views that belong to the
    profile. For example, a dedicated profile could be created for a \e {private browsing} mode. The
    current profile for the view is held by the \l profile property and the current settings are
    held by the \l settings property. The settings are specified by using the WebEngineSettings
    type.

    \section2 Platform Features

    Web pages can request access to platform features, such as geolocation or audio and video
    capture devices. The \l featurePermissionRequested() signal is emitted when a web page requests
    to make use of a resource. The supported platform features are described by the \l Feature
    property. If users grant the permission, the \l grantFeaturePermission() method is used to set
    it to \e granted.

    \section2 Rendering to OpenGL Surface

    When using a QQuickRenderControl to render a Qt Quick user interface to an OpenGL surface, the
    WebEngineView type is not rendered correctly. The web engine view attempts to use a global
    OpenGL context created by \l QtWebEngine::initialize, but there is no public API for accessing
    that context in order to share it with the \c QQuickRenderControl context.

    To have the web engine view rendered correctly, it is possible to manually create a new
    offscreen context that is shared with the \c QQuickRenderControl and to call the non-public
    function \c qt_gl_set_global_share_context(), rather than calling \c initialize().
    If \c initialize() is called after setting a global context, it will do nothing.

    back. If the offset is invalid, the page is not changed.

/*!
    \qmlproperty url WebEngineView::url

    The location of the currently displayed HTML page. This writable

    It functions the same as the \c{window.location} DOM property.

/*!
    \qmlproperty url WebEngineView::icon
    \readonly

    An internal URL for accessing the currently displayed web site icon,
    also known as favicon or shortcut icon. The icon is already downloaded
    and stored by the Qt WebEngine's favicon manager.
    This read-only URL corresponds to the image used within a mobile browser
    application to represent a bookmarked page on the device's home screen.

    The following snippet uses the \c{icon} property to build an \c{Image}
    component:

    \qml
    Image {
        id: appIcon
        sourceSize: Qt.size(32, 32)
        source: webView.icon != "" ? webView.icon : "fallbackFavicon.png";
        // ...
    }
    \endqml

    Specifying the \c{sourceSize} property of the \c{Image} element informs
    the Qt WebEngine's favicon provider about the requested size. The
    favicon provider tries to find the best fit among the web page candidate
    icons. If \c{sourceSize} property is not specified, the provider provides
    the icon with the largest resolution.

    This signal is emitted when the page's audible state is changed, due to audio

    \note The signal is also emitted when the audioMuted property changes.
    Also if the audio is paused, this signal is emitted with an approximate \b{two-second

    This signal is also emitted for Flash plugin audio.

    If a web page contains two videos that are started in sequence, this signal
    gets emitted only once, for the first video to generate sound. After both
    videos are stopped, the signal is emitted upon the last sound generated.
    This means that the signal is emitted both when any kind of sound is
    generated and when everything is completely silent within a web page,
    regardless of the number of audio streams.

    Spurious signal emissions might also happen. For example, when sound is
    stopped, this signal gets emitted first with a value of \c true, and then
    with a value of \c false. Further, when audio starts playing, the signal is
    emitted twice with a value of \c true.

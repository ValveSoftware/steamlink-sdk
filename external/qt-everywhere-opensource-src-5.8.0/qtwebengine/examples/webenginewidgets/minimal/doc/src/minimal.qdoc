    \title WebEngine Widgets Minimal Example

    \brief Displays a web page using Qt WebEngine Widgets

    \image minimal-example.png

    \e {WebEngine Widgets Minimal Example} demonstrates how to use
    \l{QWebEngineView} to render a web page. It shows the minimum amount of code
    needed to load and display an HTML page, and can be used as a basis for
    further experimentation.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \section1 The Code

    In the \c main function we first set the Qt::AA_EnableHighDpiScaling.
    This lets the web view automatically scale on high-dpi displays.

    Next, we instantiate a QApplication and a QWebEngineView. The URL
    to load is set by calling \l QWebEngineView::setUrl. The view widget is
    given a reasonable default size, and shown.
    Finally, QApplication::exec() launches the main event loop.

    \printuntil }

    \section1 Requirements

    The example requires a working internet connection to render
    the \l{Qt Homepage}.
    An optional system proxy should be picked up automatically.
    However, for proxies that require a username or password,
    you need to connect to
    QWebEnginePage::proxyAuthenticationRequired.

    \l{Qt WebEngine Widgets} uses the \l{Qt Quick Scene Graph} to compose the
    page. Therefore, OpenGL support is required.

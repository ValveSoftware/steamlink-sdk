    \title WebEngine Markdown Editor Example
    \ingroup webengine-widgetexamples
    \brief Demonstrates how to integrate a web engine in a hybrid desktop
    application.

    \e {Markdown Editor} demonstrates how to use QWebChannel and JavaScript
    libraries to provide a rich text preview tool for a custom markup language.

    \l{http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/}{Markdown} is a lightweight
    markup language with a plain text formatting syntax.
    Some services, such as \l{http://github.com}{github}, acknowledge the
    format, and render the content as rich text when viewed in a browser.

    The Markdown Editor main window is split into an editor and a preview area.
    The editor supports the Markdown syntax and is implemented by using
    QPlainTextEdit. The document is rendered as rich text in the preview area,
    which is implemented by using QWebEngineView. To render the text, the
    Markdown text is converted to HTML format with the help of a JavaScript
    library inside the web engine. The preview is updated from the editor
    through QWebChannel.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \section1 Exposing Document Text

    Because we expose the current Markdown text to be rendered to the web engine
    through QWebChannel, we need to somehow make the current text available
    through the Qt metatype system. This is done by using a dedicated
    \c Document class that exposes the document text as a \c{Q_PROPERTY}:

    \quotefromfile webenginewidgets/markdowneditor/document.h
    \skipto class Document
    \printto #endif

    The \c Document class wraps a QString to be set on the C++ side with
    the \c setText() method and exposes it at runtime as a \c text property
    with a \c textChanged signal.

    We define the \c setText method as follows:

    \quotefromfile webenginewidgets/markdowneditor/document.cpp
    \skipto Document::setText
    \printuntil

    \section1 Previewing Text

    We implement our own \c PreviewPage class that publicly inherits from
    \c QWebEnginePage:

    \quotefromfile webenginewidgets/markdowneditor/previewpage.h
    \skipto class PreviewPage
    \printto #endif

    We reimplement the virtual \c acceptNavigationRequest method to
    stop the page from navigating away from the current document. Instead,
    we redirect external links to the system browser:

    \quotefromfile webenginewidgets/markdowneditor/previewpage.cpp
    \skipto acceptNavigationRequest
    \printuntil

    \section1 Creating the Main Window

    The \c MainWindow class inherits the QMainWindow class:

    \quotefromfile webenginewidgets/markdowneditor/mainwindow.h
    \skipto class MainWindow :
    \printto endif

    The class declares private slots that match the actions in the menu,
    as well as the \c isModified() helper method.

    The actual layout of the main window is specified in a \c .ui file.
    The widgets and actions are available at runtime in the \c ui member
    variable.

    \c m_filePath holds the file path to the currently loaded document.
    \c m_content is an instance of the \c Document class.

    The actual setup of the different objects is done in the \c MainWindow
    constructor:

    \quotefromfile webenginewidgets/markdowneditor/mainwindow.cpp
    \skipto MainWindow::MainWindow
    \printto PreviewPage

    The constructor first calls \c setupUi to construct the widgets and menu
    actions according to the UI file. The text editor font is set to one
    with a fixed character width, and the QWebEngineView widget is told not
    to show a context menu.

    \printto connect

    Here the constructor makes sure our custom
    \c PreviewPage is used by the QWebEngineView instance in \c{ui->preview}.

    \printto ui->preview

    Here the \c textChanged signal of the editor is connected to a lambda that
    updates the text in \c m_content. This object is then exposed to the JS side
    by \c QWebChannel under the name \c{content}.

    \printto connect

    Now we can actually load the \e index.html file from the
    resources. For more information about the file, see
    \l{Creating an Index File}.

    \printto defaultTextFile

    The menu items are connected to the mapping member slots. The
    \uicontrol Save item is activated or deactivated depending on whether
    the user has edited the content.

    \printuntil }

    Finally, we load a default document \e default.md from the resources.

    \section1 Creating an Index File

    \quotefile webenginewidgets/markdowneditor/resources/index.html

    In the \e index.html, we load a custom stylesheet and two JavaScript
    libraries. \l{http://kevinburke.bitbucket.org/markdowncss/}{markdown.css} is
    a markdown-friendly stylesheet created by Kevin Burke.
    \l{https://github.com/chjj/marked}{marked.min.js} is a markdown parser and
    compiler designed for speed written by Christopher Jeffrey and
    \e qwebchannel.js is part of the \l{QWebChannel} module.

    In the \c <body> element we first define a \c placeholder element, and
    make it available as a JavaScript variable. We then define the \c updateText
    helper method that updates the content of \c placeholder with the HTML
    that the JavaScript method \c marked() returns.

    Finally, we set up the web channel to access the \c content proxy object
    and make sure that \c updateText() is called whenever \c content.text
    changes.

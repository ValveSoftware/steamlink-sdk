  \title Getting Started with Qt Purchasing in C++
  \brief Guide to getting started with Qt Purchasing using C++.

  This guide assumes that you have registered the in-app products for your
  application in the external store. For more information about registering
  products, see \l{Registering Products in Google Play},
  \l{Registering Products in App Store}, and
  \l{Registering Products in Windows Store}.

  \section1 Preparing the Application

  Use the following include statement to access the C++ classes:

  \code
  #include <QtPurchasing>
  \endcode

  Before building your application, add the following statement to your \c .pro
  file to link against the Qt Purchasing library:

  \code
  QT += purchasing
  \endcode


  \section1 Registering Products

  In order to allow in-app purchases in your application, register the
  products in your application. Start by creating an application-global instance of
  \l QInAppStore, and use the registerProduct() function to register each product.

  The following example is a hypothetical role-playing game, which provides two
  in-app products to the user.

  \code
  MyApplication::MyApplication(QObject *parent)
      : QObject(parent)
  {
      m_myStore = new QInAppStore(this);
      setupConnections();

      m_myStore->registerProduct(QInAppProduct::Consumable,
                                 QStringLiteral("healthPotion"));
      m_myStore->registerProduct(QInAppProduct::Unlockable,
                                 QStringLiteral("dlcForestOfFooBar"));
  }
  \endcode

  As you can see, there are \l{QInAppProduct::Consumable}{consumable products} and
  \l{QInAppProduct::Unlockable}{unlockable products}. The former can be purchased
  any number of times by the same user, whereas the latter can only be purchased
  once.

  In our example, the \c "healthPotion" is a consumable product, because the user should
  be able to buy any number of health potions and add them to their in-game inventory.

  The \c "dlcForestOfFooBar" is downloadable content, which unlocks a new part
  of the game, and once it is bought, the purchase should be persistent across
  the user's devices and across reinstallations.

  \section1 Making Connections

  Registering a product is an asynchronous operation, as are all operations
  supported by Qt Purchasing. Before you start registering a product, you must
  listen to the \l{QInAppStore::productRegistered()} and
  \l{QInAppStore::productUnknown()} signals in QInAppStore to know the status
  of your registration.

  If the application intends to allow users to purchase products, it also needs
  to listen for the \l{QInAppStore::transactionReady()} signal to be notified
  when a transaction is pending.

  \code
  void MyApplication::setupConnections()
  {
      connect(m_myStore, SIGNAL(productRegistered(QInAppProduct*)),
              this, SLOT(markProductAvailable(QInAppProduct*)));
      connect(m_myStore, SIGNAL(productUnknown(QInAppProduct*)),
              this, SLOT(handleErrorGracefully(QInAppProduct*)));

      connect(m_myStore, SIGNAL(transactionReady(QInAppTransaction*)),
              this, SLOT(handleTransaction(QInAppTransaction*)));
  }
  \endcode

  \section1 Purchasing A Product

  When the user wants to purchase a product, call \l{QInAppProduct::purchase()}
  on the product. This launches a platform-specific, asynchronous process to
  purchase the product, for example by requesting the user's password and
  confirmation of the purchase. In most cases, you must make sure that the
  application UI is not accepting input while the purchase request is being
  processed, as this is not handled automatically on all platforms.

  \code
  void MyApplication::purchaseHealthPotion()
  {
      QInAppProduct *product = m_myStore->registeredProduct(QStringLiteral("healthPotion"));

      // Should not get here if product is not registered
      Q_ASSERT(product != 0);

      product->purchase();
  }
  \endcode

  When this function is called, the purchase process is initiated. At some
  point during the process, the \l{QInAppStore::transactionReady()} signal is
  emitted, and the slot registered earlier is called. In this function, you
  can save data about a successful purchase so that it survives across
  application runs. After verifying that the data has been stored, finalize the
  transaction. If the transaction fails, display information about the
  failure to the user and finalize the transaction.

  \code
  void MyApplication::handleTransaction(QInAppTransaction *transaction)
  {
      if (transaction->status() == QInAppTransaction::PurchaseApproved
          && transaction->product()->identifier() == QStringLiteral("healthPotion")) {
          if (!hasAlreadyStoredTransaction(transaction->orderId()) {
              ++m_healthPotions;
              if (!addHealthPotionToPersistentStorage(transaction->orderId())
                  popupErrorDialog(tr("Unable to write to persistent storage. Please make sure there is sufficient space and restart."))
              else
                  transaction->finalize();
          }
      } else if (transaction->status() == QInAppTransaction::PurchaseFailed) {
          popupErrorDialog(tr("Purchase not completed."));
          transaction->finalize();
      }
  }
  \endcode

  If a transaction is not finalized, the
  \l{QInAppStore::transactionReady()}{transactionReady() signal} is emitted
  again for the same transaction the next time the product is registered,
  providing another chance to store the data. The transaction for a consumable
  product must be finalized before the product can be purchased again.

  \section1 Restoring Previously Purchased Products

  If the application is uninstalled and subsequently reinstalled (or installed
  by the same user on a different device), you must provide a way to restore
  the previously purchased unlockable products.

  To start the process of restoring purchases, call the
  \l{QInAppStore::restorePurchases()} function. This emits the
  \l{QInAppStore::transactionReady()} signal for each of the application's
  unlockable products that were purchased previously by the current user. The
  status of these transactions will be \l{QInAppTransaction::PurchaseRestored}.

  Continuing on the example from earlier, lets imagine that the game has
  downloadable content that you can buy to extend the game further. This must
  be an unlockable product, because the user need not purchase it more than
  once.

  \code
  void MyApplication::handleTransaction(QInAppTransaction *transaction)
  {
      if ((transaction->status() == QInAppTransaction::PurchaseApproved
           || transaction->status() == QInAppTransaction::PurchaseRestored)
          && transaction->product()->identifier() == QStringLiteral("dlcForestOfFooBar"))
      {

          if (!hasMap(QStringLiteral("forestOfFooBar.map")) {
              if (!downloadExtraMap(QStringLiteral("forestOfFooBar.map")))
                  popupErrorDialog(tr("Unable to download The Forest of FooBar map. Please make sure there is sufficient space and restart."))
              else
                  transaction->finalize()
          }

      } else if (transaction->status() == QInAppTransaction::PurchaseApproved
          && transaction->product()->identifier() == QStringLiteral("healthPotion")) {

          // ... handle healthPotion purchase

      } else {
          popupErrorDialog(tr("Purchase not completed."));
          transaction->finalize();
      }
  }
  \endcode

  If a user buys the downloadable content and later either installs the game on
  another device or uninstalls and reinstalls the game, you can provide a way
  to restore the purchase by calling \l{QInAppStore::restorePurchases()}.
  Purchases must be restored in response to a user input, as it may present a
  password dialog on some platforms.

  \note While the function behaves as documented on Android, this functionality
  is technically not needed there. Android manages all unlockable purchases
  with no intervention from the application. If an application is uninstalled
  and reinstalled (or installed on a different Android device),
  \l{QInAppStore::transactionReady()} is emitted at application start-up for
  each previously purchased unlockable product, with the
                             \l{QInAppTransaction::PurchaseApproved} status.

    \title Qt Quick System Dialog Examples
    \example systemdialogs
    \brief This example demonstrates the system dialog types in QML
    \image systemdialogs-example.jpg
    \ingroup qtquickdialog_examples

    This example demonstrates the system dialogs in the \l{Qt Quick Dialogs}
    module. The appearance and behavior is platform-dependent.

    A \l FileDialog is used to choose a single file, multiple files or a
    single directory, depending on how it is configured.
    \snippet systemdialogs/FileDialogs.qml filedialog

    A \l ColorDialog is used to choose a color, with or without alpha (transparency)
    depending on how it is configured.
    \snippet systemdialogs/ColorDialogs.qml colordialog

    The example can be built as a standalone executable, but each
    type of dialog is demonstrated in a separate QML file which can
    also be run separately with qmlscene.

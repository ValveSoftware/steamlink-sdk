    \title Qt WebSockets
    \brief Provides an implementation of the WebSocket protocol.

    WebSocket is a web-based protocol designed to enable two-way communication
    between a client application and a remote host. It enables the two entities
    to send data back and forth if the initial handshake succeeds. WebSocket is
    the solution for applications that struggle to get real-time data feeds
    with less network latency and minimum data exchange.

    The Qt WebSockets module provides C++ and QML interfaces that enable
    Qt applications to act as a server that can process WebSocket requests,
    or a client that can consume data received from the server, or both.

    \section1 Getting Started

    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the following directive:

    \code
    #include <QtWebSockets/QtWebSockets>
    \endcode

    To  import the QML types into your application, use the following import statement in your .qml file:

    \code
    import QtWebSockets 1.0
    \endcode

    To link against the module, add this line to your qmake .pro file:

    \code
    QT += websockets
    \endcode

    \title Testing Qt WebSockets

    \l {Autobahn|Testsuite}, a standard test
    suite for WebSocket Protocol (\l{RFC 6455}), can be used for testing the
    conformance of Qt WebSockets. Refer to
    \l {Autobahn|Testsuite installation documentation}
    to set up the test suite.

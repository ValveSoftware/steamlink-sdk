\section1 Overview

Bluetooth is a short-range (less than 100 meters) wireless technology. It
has a reasonably high data transfer rate of 2.1 Mbit/s, which makes it ideal
for transferring data between devices. Bluetooth connectivity is based on
basic device management, such as scanning for devices, gathering information
about them, and exchanging data between them.

Qt Bluetooth supports Bluetooth Low Energy development for client/central role use cases.
Further details can be found in the
\l {Bluetooth Low Energy Overview}{Bluetooth Low Energy Overview} section.

A new addition since the Qt Bluetooth 5.7 release covers support for Bluetooth Low Energy
applications performing the peripheral/server role. This new API remains in Technology Preview.

\section1 Getting Started

To use the C++ library in your application, add the following configuration
option to your \c .pro file:

\snippet snippets.pro contacts project modification

To use the classes of the module in your application you need the following
import statement in your \c .qml file:

\snippet doc_src_qtbluetooth.qml import

\section2 Building Qt Bluetooth

Despite the fact that the module can be built for all Qt platforms,
the module is not ported to all of them. Not supported platforms such as Windows desktop
employ a fake or dummy backend which is automatically selected when the
platform is not supported. The dummy backend reports appropriate error messages
and values which allow the Qt Bluetooth developer to detect at runtime that the
current platform is not supported. The dummy backend is also selected on Linux if
BlueZ development headers are not found during build time or Qt was built without
Qt D-Bus support.

The usage of the dummy backend is highlighted via an appropriate warning while building and running.

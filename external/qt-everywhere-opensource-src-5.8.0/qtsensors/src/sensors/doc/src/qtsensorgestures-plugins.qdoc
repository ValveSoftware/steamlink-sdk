\title QtSensorGestures Plugins
\brief Explains how to develop recognizer plugins with QtSensorGestures

The QtSensorGestures recognizer plugins are the way to create your own
sensor gestures.

Creating software to recognize motion gestures using sensors is a huge subject not covered here.

The QSensorGesture API does not limit usage to any of the common classification methods of gesture
recognition, such as Hidden Markov Models, Neural Networks, Dynamic Time Warping, or even the
ad-hoc heuristic recognizers of Qt's built-in sensor gesture recognizers. It's basically a
signaling system for lower level gesture recogition methods and algorithms to communicate to the
higher level applications.

\tableofcontents

\section1 Overview

    The steps for creating a sensor gesture plugin are as follows:
\list
\li Sub-class from QSensorGesturePluginInterface
\li Sub-class from QSensorGestureRecognizer and implement gesture recognizer logic using QtSensors.
\li Create an instance of that recognizer in the derived QSensorGesturePluginInterface class, and call
 QSensorGestureManager::registerSensorGestureRecognizer(sRec); in your registerRecognizers()
function. QSensorGestureManager will retain ownership of the recognizer object.

This is the class in which the gesture recognizer system should be implemented from.

\section2 Recognizer Classes

If you are making sensorgestures available through the QtSensorGestures API, these are the
classes to subclass.

\section3 Recognizer Plugins

The Sensor Gesture Recognizers that come with Qt are made using an ad-hoc heuristic approach.
The user cannot define their own gestures, and must learn how to perform and accommodate the
pre-defined gestures herein.

A developer may use any method, including computationally- and training-intensive well-
known classifiers, to produce gesture recognizers. There are currently no classes in Qt for
gesture training, nor is it possible for the user to define his own sensor-based motion gestures.

A procedure for writing ad-hoc recognizers might include:
\list
    \li Obtain and gather output from the accelerometer through \c QAccelerometerReading of a gesture being performed.
    \li Use various methods and constraints on the accelerometer data to recognize the various states:
    \list i
        \li Initial "listening" state for a gesture
        \li Start of a possible gesture, moving into a "detecting" state
        \li End of a possible gesture, moving into a "recognizing" state
        \li and finally, if it is recognized, the "recognized" state, or if not recognized, move back to
           the "listening" state.
    \endlist
    \li Test procedure to make sure it is easy to perform, and will not
 produce too many false positive recognitions, or collisions if used with other gestures. Meaning
that gestures performed get recognized as another gesture instead.

\endlist

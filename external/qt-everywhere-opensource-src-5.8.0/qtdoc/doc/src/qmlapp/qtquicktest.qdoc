    \title Qt Quick Test Reference Documentation
    \brief unit testing framework for QML

    \section1 Introduction

    \l {Qt Quick Test QML Types}{Qt Quick Test} is a unit test framework for QML applications.
    Test cases are written as JavaScript functions within a \l {QtTest::TestCase}{TestCase}
    type:

    \code
    import QtQuick 2.3
    import QtTest 1.0

    TestCase {
        name: "MathTests"

        function test_math() {
            compare(2 + 2, 4, "2 + 2 = 4")
        }

        function test_fail() {
            compare(2 + 2, 5, "2 + 2 = 5")
        }
    }
    \endcode

    Functions whose names start with \c{test_} are treated as test cases
    to be executed. See the documentation for the \l {QtTest::TestCase}{TestCase} and
    \l {QtTest::SignalSpy}{SignalSpy} types for more information on writing test cases.

    \section1 Running Tests

    Test cases are launched by a C++ harness that consists of
    the following code:

    \code
    #include <QtQuickTest/quicktest.h>
    QUICK_TEST_MAIN(example)
    \endcode

    Where "example" is the identifier to use to uniquely identify
    this set of tests. You should add \c{CONFIG += qmltestcase}.
    for example:

    \code
    TEMPLATE = app
    TARGET = tst_example
    CONFIG += warn_on qmltestcase
    SOURCES += tst_example.cpp
    \endcode

    The test harness scans the specified source directory recursively
    for "tst_*.qml" files. If \c{QUICK_TEST_SOURCE_DIR} is not defined,
    then the current directory will be scanned when the harness is run.
    Other *.qml files may appear for auxillary QML components that are
    used by the test.

    The \c{-input} command-line option can be set at runtime to run
    test cases from a different directory. This may be needed to run
    tests on a target device where the compiled-in directory name refers
    to a host. For example:

    \code
    tst_example -input /mnt/SDCard/qmltests
    \endcode

    It is also possible to run a single file using the \c{-input} option.
    For example:

    \code
    tst_example -input data/test.qml
    \endcode

    \code
    tst_example -input <full_path>/test.qml
    \endcode

    \note Specifying the full path to the qml test file is for example
    needed for shadow builds.

    If your test case needs QML imports, then you can add them as
    \c{-import} options to the test program command-line.

    If IMPORTPATH is specified in your .pro file, each import path added to IMPORTPATH
    will be passed as a command-line argument when the test is run using "make check":

    \code
    IMPORTPATH += $$PWD/../imports/my_module1 $$PWD/../imports/my_module2
    \endcode

    The \c{-functions} command-line option will return a list of the current
    tests functions. It is possible to run a single test function using the name
    of the test function as an argument. For example:

    \code
    tst_example Test_Name::function1
    \endcode

    The \c{-help} command-line option will return all the options available.

    \code
    tst_example -help
    \endcode

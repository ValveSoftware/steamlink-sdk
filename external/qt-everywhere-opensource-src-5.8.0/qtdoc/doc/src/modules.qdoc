    \title The qtmain Library
    \ingroup licensing
    \brief Commercial and \l{BSD 3-clause "New" or "Revised" License}.

    qtmain is a helper library that enables the developer to write a
    cross-platform main() function on Windows.
    If you do not use \l qmake or other build tools such as
    \l{CMake Manual}{CMake}, then you need to link against the
    \c qtmain library.

    The qtmain library is statically linked with the application.
    To avoid issues with static linking and the
    \l{GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)},
    it is licensed both under the commercial licenses,
    and the \l{BSD 3-clause "New" or "Revised" License}.

    \title Qt 3D: Scene3D QML Example
    \ingroup qt3d-examples-qml
    \brief A QML application that demonstrates visualizing a 3D scene.

    \image scene3d.png

    \e {Scene3D} demonstrates visualizing a 3D scene from a Qt Quick
    application. The 3D scene contains a single active camera and a single
    active light source. Visualized data is assumed to be at a fixed location.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \section1 Visualizing 3D Scenes

    We set up the 3D scene and specify the entity to animate in \e main.qml:

    \quotefromfile scene3d/main.qml
    \skipto Scene3D {
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    We specify the active camera in \e scene3d/AnimatedEntity.qml:

    \quotefromfile scene3d/AnimatedEntity.qml
    \skipto Camera
    \printuntil }
*/

Description: A malloc(3) debugger
 Electric Fence is a debugger that uses virtual memory hardware to detect
 illegal memory accesses. It can detect two common programming bugs: software
 that overruns or underruns the boundaries of a malloc() memory allocation,
 and software that touches a memory allocation that has been released by
 free(). 
 .
 Unlike other malloc() debuggers, Electric Fence will detect read accesses as
 well as writes, and it will stop and pinpoint the exact instruction that
 causes an error. It is not as thorough as Purify, however.
 . 
 In order to debug a program it needs to be linked with Electric Fence's
 library or dynamic linking needs to be used; README.Debian explains that in
 detail.

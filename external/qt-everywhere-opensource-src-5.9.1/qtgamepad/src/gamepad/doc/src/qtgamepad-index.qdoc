  \title Qt Gamepad
  \brief A cross-platform library to facilitate the use of gamepad hardware in Qt and Qt Quick applications.

  Qt Gamepad is an add-on library that enables Qt applications to support the
  use of gamepad hardware and in some cases remote control equipment.  The
  module provides both QML and C++ interfaces. The primary target audience are
  embedded devices with fullscreen user interfaces, and mobile applications
  targeting TV-like form factors.

  The currently supported platforms are:

  \list
  \li Windows (Win32 desktop, via XInput 1.3 & 1.4)
  \li Linux (evdev)
  \li Linux (SDL2)
  \li Android
  \li macOS, iOS, tvOS (including the tvOS remote)
  \endlist

  This module provides classes that can:

  \list
  \li Read input events from game controllers (Button and Axis events),
  \li expose these events both to C++ and Qt Quick (QML),
  \li provide basic gamepad layout configurability, and
  \li provide optional key and mouse event generation upon gamepad button presses.
  \endlist

  \note The API is designed with XBox and similar controllers in mind. Joysticks
  are not in scope for this module. A number of third-party gamepads may be
  supported as well, however, some of these may need custom configuration steps
  in order to map the button/trigger codes the device or driver in question
  provides onto what QtGamepad expects. The can be done by the
  \l{Qt Gamepad Configure Buttons Example}{configureButtons} example that can also
  save the generated layout persistently for use by other applications.

  \section1 Getting Started

  Before you start using the APIs provided by this module, ensure that the
  gamepad is detected by your development environment.

  \section2 Linux

  On standard Linux distributions such as Ubuntu, gamepads such as XBox or
  PlayStation controllers are detected out-of-the-box. To check if the
  gamepad is detected, \c grep the \c dmesg logs using:

  \badcode
  dmesg | grep "<gamepad-make>"
  \endcode

  If you do not see the entries for the gamepad you are using, check if
  the \c joystick package is installed. If not, install the package and \c grep
  the \c dmesg logs again.

  It is strongly recommended to verify that the gamepad's input device is
  present, and is sending events, via the \c lsinput and \c evtest utilities.

  PlayStation controllers will likely need the help of an additional tool like
  \l{https://github.com/xboxdrv/xboxdrv}{xboxdrv}. Once installed, and having a
  PS3 controller connected via USB, the following will ensure correct operation
  with QtGamepad:

  \badcode
  sudo xboxdrv --detach-kernel-driver --mimic-xpad -s
  \endcode

  Qt Gamepad uses a plugin-based, multi-backend architecture. This means that on
  some platforms, like Linux, there are multiple backends available. In case of
  Linux, the choices are:

  \list

  \li \c evdev - a backend reading events directly from the evdev input device

  \li \c sdl2 - a backend using the Gamepad module of SDL2. This plugin is only
  built when SDL2 is present at build time, and therefore will typically be
  missing from the pre-built Qt packages. This backend likely has broader
  support for various hardware, at the expense of an additional third-party
  dependency.

  \endlist

  To force a given backend, set the \c QT_GAMEPAD environment variable to the
  name of the desired backend.

  The availability of gamepad devices is monitored via \c libudev, assuming Qt
  was built with libudev support enabled. This means that connecting wired
  gamepads or wireless dongles is possible also while an application is
  running.

  \note wireless dongles may report one or more input devices even when no
  actual controllers have been connected to them. Qt Gamepad will interpret this
  as having connected gamepads present.

  With the \c evdev backend, to explicitly specify the input device to use, set
  the environment variable \c{QT_GAMEPAD_DEVICE} to the desired
  /dev/input/event* node. This should not be needed normally, but can be useful
  in case multiple gamepads are connected and only one of them is interesting to
  the application.

  \section2 Windows

  The Windows Plug-n-Play service automatically installs the necessary drivers
  when the gamepad is connected through a USB port for the first time. Once the
  drivers are installed, select \uicontrol{Control Panel > Device and Printers}
  and check if the gamepad is listed under the \uicontrol Devices section.

  To test whether gamepad input is detected, select
  \uicontrol {Gamepad Controller Settings} from the context menu, select
  \uicontrol {Properties > Test}, and start testing. You can also run the
  \l{Qt Gamepad Qt Quick Example}{quickGamepad} example to test.

  \section2 Android

  The Android backend uses the \c InputDevice API.

  \section2 macOS, iOS, tvOS

  This backend uses the \c GCController API.

  Besides game controllers, it also supports the tvOS remote (microGamepad). The
  mapping for this is the following:

  \list
  \li \c{X button} - play/pause
  \li \c{A button} - pressing the touch area
  \li \c{left thumbstick} - the touch area
  \endlist

  \section2 Troubleshooting

  Some backends (\c evdev on Linux and \c xinput on Windows) and the plugin
  loader utilize the logging category \c{qt.gamepad}. Enabling this will print
  useful information on the debug output.

  \section1 Examples

  The \l{Qt Gamepad Examples}{examples} demonstrate how to handle input from a
  gamepad using the QML and C++ APIs.

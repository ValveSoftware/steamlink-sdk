    \title Qt Canvas 3D
    \page qtcanvas3d-index.html
    \brief Provides functionality for 3D drawing inside Qt Quick 2.

    Qt Canvas 3D module provides a way to make WebGL-like 3D drawing calls
    from Qt Quick JavaScript.

    \section1 Features

    \list
        \li Uses OpenGL or OpenGL ES 2 for rendering.
        \li Qt Quick 2 support.
        \li Use Qt Quick items as texture sources.

            background or foreground.
    \endlist

    \section1 Getting Started

    To import Qt Canvas 3D QML types, add the following import statement to
    your \c .qml file:

    \snippet doc_src_qtcanvas3d.cpp 0

    See the \l{Qt Canvas 3D Getting Started}{Getting Started} page for further

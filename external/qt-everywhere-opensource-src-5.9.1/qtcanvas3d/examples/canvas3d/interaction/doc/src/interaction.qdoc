    \brief Interact with an object in canvas using Qt Quick Controls

    The Interaction Example concentrates on the interaction between
    \l {Qt Quick Controls} and the objects displayed in Canvas3D. This
    also demonstrates drawing the same object in three different ways.

    \image interaction-example.png

    \section1 The Controls

    First, we need to import Qt Quick Controls and Layouts:

    \snippet interaction/qml/interaction/main.qml 0

    Then, we add a RowLayout to the main component to easily add the
    controls side-by-side:

    \snippet interaction/qml/interaction/main.qml 1

    And then we add three sliders to the layout. Here's the one for
    controlling x-axis rotation:

    \snippet interaction/qml/interaction/main.qml 2

    \section1 Interaction

    First we need to define some properties in the Canvas3D for the
    rotations:

    \snippet interaction/qml/interaction/main.qml 3

    The \c onValueChanged signal handlers of the \l[QML]{Slider} components
    are connected to the above properties. Here's the connection in x-rotation
    slider as an example:

    \snippet interaction/qml/interaction/main.qml 4

    Then, on the JavaScript side, we just use the Canvas3D properties directly
    when setting the modelview matrix rotations:

    \snippet interaction/qml/interaction/interaction.js 0

    \section1 Three Ways of Drawing

    The actual drawing is no different from any situation where
    the same object is drawn multiple times. Only in this case we use a
    different drawing mode for each:

    \snippet interaction/qml/interaction/interaction.js 1
    \dots 0
    \snippet interaction/qml/interaction/interaction.js 2
    \dots 0
    \snippet interaction/qml/interaction/interaction.js 3

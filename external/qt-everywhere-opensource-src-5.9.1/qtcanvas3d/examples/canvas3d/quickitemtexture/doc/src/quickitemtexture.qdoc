    \title Qt Quick Item as Texture Example
    \ingroup qtcanvas3d-examples
    \brief A simple cube with a Qt Quick item as a texture

    The Qt Quick Item as Texture example shows how to use other Qt Quick items as
    a texture source for Qt Canvas3D textures.

    \image quickitemtexture-example.png

    \section1 Using Qt Quick Item as a Texture

    First we create a \l Rectangle with a label that displays the current frame rate and rotation
    values of the cube:

    \snippet quickitemtexture/qml/quickitemtexture/main.qml 0

    We want to use the above \l Rectangle as the texture on our 3D cube. As a \l Rectangle item
    doesn't implement QQuickItem::textureProvider() by itself, we make it layered by setting the
    \c{layer.enabled} property to \c{true}.

    To create a Canvas3DTexture out of our layered \l{Rectangle}, we create a
    \l{Canvas3DTextureProvider}{QTCANVAS3D_texture_provider} extension and the texture
    in the \c initializeGL() function in our JavaScript implementation:

    \snippet quickitemtexture/qml/quickitemtexture/quickitemtexture.js 0

    Once the \c cubeTexture item is created, it can be used like any other texture item in
    the JavaScript.

    \note The method of creating the texture from a Qt Quick item differs from how one would create
    texture from an HTML item in WebGL API. Textures created with
    \l{Canvas3DTextureProvider}{QTCANVAS3D_texture_provider} extension
    support automatic live updates, without having to call textureImage2D each frame
    to re-upload fresh texture data from the item.

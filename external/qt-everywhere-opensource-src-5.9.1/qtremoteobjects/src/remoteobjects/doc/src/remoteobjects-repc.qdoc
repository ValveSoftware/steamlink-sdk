\brief The Qt Remote Objects Compiler creates \l {Source} and \l {Replica} header files
\ingroup overviews
\keyword repc

    \section1 REPC Overview

    The \underline {Rep}lica \underline {C}ompiler (repc) generates QObject
    header files based on an API definition file. The file (called a "rep"
    file) uses a specific (text) syntax to describe the API. By convention,
    these files are given a .rep file extension, short for Replica. When these
    files are processed by repc, repc generates both \l {Source} and \l
    {Replica} header files.

    The Qt Remote Objects module also includes qmake macros (\l REPC_SOURCE, \l
    REPC_REPLICA) that can be added to your project file to automatically run
    repc, and add the resulting files to the list of files processed by
    \l{moc}{Meta Object Compiler} during the build process, making use of Qt
    Remote Objects in your projects simple.

    While Qt Remote Objects supports sharing QObjects over the network (using
    enableRemoting on the Source side and acquireDynamic on the Replica side),
    there are a couple of advantages to letting repc define your objects. First
    of all, while \l {QRemoteObjectDynamicReplica} {DynamicReplicas} are
    useful, they are more cumbersome to work with. The API is not known until
    the object is initialized, and using the API from C++ requires string
    lookups through QMetaObject's methods. Secondly, having the interface known
    at compile time finds any issues at compile vs. at runtime. Thirdly, the rep
    format supports default values, which can be handy if you are unable to
    ensure the Source is available when the Replica is instantiated.

    See the documentation \l {Source} {Sources here} for information on using
    the generated files in your code. Here we will focus on the repc format and
    options.

    \section1 The rep file format

    The rep file format is a simple \l {Domain Specific Language (DSL)} for
    describing an interface supported over Qt Remote Objects (QtRO). Since QtRO
    is an object based system, these interfaces are defined by APIs available
    through objects, that is, classes with properties, signals, and slots.

    \section2 The class type

    Each class defined in a rep file becomes a QObject in the generated header
    files, with the described API generated for you.

    To define a class use the \c class keyword, followed by the name you
    want for your type, and then enclose your API in brackets like so
    \code
        class MyType
        {
            //PROP/SIGNAL/SLOT/ENUM declarations to define your API
        };
    \endcode

    \section3 PROP

    Q_PROPERTY elements are created by using the PROP keyword in the rep
    file. The syntax is the \c PROP keyword followed by the definition enclosed
    in quotes, where the definition is the type, the name, and (optionally) a
    default value or attributes.
    \code
        PROP(bool simpleBool)                // boolean named simpleBool
        PROP(bool defaultFalseBool=false)    // boolean named defaultFalseBool, with false
                                             // as the default value

        PROP(int lifeUniverseEverything=42)  // int value that defaults to 42
        PROP(QByteArray myBinaryInfo)        // Qt types are fine, may need #include
                                             // additional headers in your rep file

        PROP(QString name CONSTANT)          // Property with the CONSTANT attribute
        PROP(QString setable READWRITE)      // Property with the READWRITE attribute
                                             // note: Properties default to READPUSH
                                             // (see description below)

        PROP(SomeOtherType myCustomType)     // Custom types work. Needs #include for the
                                             // appropriate header for your type, make
                                             // sure your type is known to the metabject
                                             // system, and make sure it supports Queued
                                             // Connections (see Q_DECLARE_METATYPE and
                                             // qRegisterMetaType)
    \endcode
    More information about creating custom types can be found \l {Creating
    Custom Qt Types} {here}.

    By default, properties will have getters and a "push" Slot defined, as well
    as a notify signal emitted when the value is changed. Qt Remote Objects
    requires the notify signal on the Source object to trigger sending updates
    to the attached Replicas. In earlier versions of QtRO, properties defaulted
    to being read/write, that is, having getters and setters. However, due to the
    asynchronous nature of QtRO, this led to unintuitive behavior at times.
    Setting the READWRITE attribute on the PROP will provide the old (getter
    and setter) behavior.
    \code
        // In .rep file, old (setter) behavior
        PROP(int myVal READWRITE)             // Old behavior with setMyVal(int myVal) method

        // In code...  Assume myVal is initially set to 0 in Source
        int originalValue = rep->myVal();     // Will be 0
        rep->setMyVal(10);                    // Call setter, expecting a blocking/
                                              // non-asynchronous return

        if (rep->myVal() == 10) ...           // Test will usually fail
    \endcode

    If it is necessary to block until the value is changed, something like the
    following is necessary.
    \code
        // In .rep file, old (setter) behavior
        PROP(int myVal READWRITE)             // Old behavior with setMyVal(int myVal) method

        // In code...  Assume myVal is initially set to 0 in Source
        bool originalValue = rep->myVal();    // Will be 0

        // We can wait for the change using \l QSignalSpy
        QSignalSpy spy(rep, SIGNAL(myValChanged(int)));

        rep->setMyVal(10);                    // Call setter, expecting a blocking/
                                              // non-asynchronous return

        spy.wait();                           // spy.wait() blocks until changed signal
                                              // is received
        if (rep->myVal() == 10) ...           // Test will succeed assuming
                                              // 1. Source object is connected
                                              // 2. Nobody else (Source or other Replica)
                                              //    sets the myVal to something else (race
                                              //    condition)
        // Rather than use QSignalSpy, the event-driven practice would be to connect the
        // myValChanged notify signal to a Slot that responds to the changes.
    \endcode

    QtRO now defaults to READPUSH, which provides an automatically generated
    Slot for requesting a property change.
    \code
        // In .rep file, defaults to READPUSH
        PROP(bool myVal)                      // No setMyVal(int myVal) on Replica, has
                                              // pushMyVal(int myVal) instead

        // In code...  Assume myVal is initially set to 0 in Source
        bool originalValue = rep->myVal();    // Will be 0

        // We can wait for the change using \l QSignalSpy
        QSignalSpy spy(rep, SIGNAL(myValChanged(int)));

        rep->pushMyVal(10);                   // Call push method, no expectation that change
                                              // is applied upon method completion.

        // Some way of waiting for change to be received by the Replica is still necessary,
        // but hopefully not a surprise with the new pushMyVal() Slot.
        spy.wait();                           // spy.wait() blocks until changed signal
                                              // is received
        if (rep->myVal() == 10) ...           // Test will succeed assuming
                                              // 1. Source object is connected
                                              // 2. Nobody else (Source or other Replica)
                                              //    set the myVal to something else (race
                                              //    condition)
    \endcode

    You can also use the \c CONSTANT, \c READONLY, \c PERSISTED, \c READWRITE,
    or \c READPUSH keywords in the PROP declaration, which affects how this is
    implemented.  READPUSH is the default value if no value used.

    \code
        PROP(int lifeUniverseEverything=42 CONSTANT)
        PROP(QString name READONLY)
    \endcode

    Please note there are some subtleties here. A CONSTANT PROP has a
    Q_PROPERTY declared as CONSTANT on the SOURCE side. However, replicas
    cannot know the correct value until they are initialized, which means the
    property value has to be allowed to change during initialization. For
    READONLY, the Source will have neither a setter nor a push slot, and the
    replica side will not have a push slot generated. Adding the PERSISTED
    trait to a PROP will have the PROP use the \l QRemoteObjectPersistedStore
    instance set on a Node (if any) to save/restore PROP values.

    \sa QRemoteObjectPersistedStore

    \section3 SIGNAL

    \l [DOC QtCore] {Signals} {Signal} methods are created by using the SIGNAL keyword in the rep file.

    Usage is to declare \c SIGNAL followed by the desired signature wrapped in
    parentheses. The void return value should be skipped.

    \code
        SIGNAL(test())
        SIGNAL(test(QString foo, int bar))
        SIGNAL(test(QMap<QString,int> foo))
        SIGNAL(test(const QString &foo))
        SIGNAL(test(QString &foo))
    \endcode

    Just like in Qt \l {Qt::ConnectionType} {queued connections}, parameters in signals that are
    references will be copied when being passed to replicas.

    \section3 SLOT

    \l [DOC QtCore] {Slots} {Slot} methods are created by using the SLOT keyword in the rep file.

    Usage is to declare \c SLOT followed by the desired signature wrapped in
    parentheses. The return value can be included in the declaration. If the
    return value is skipped, void will be used in the generated files.

    \code
        SLOT(test())
        SLOT(void test(QString foo, int bar))
        SLOT(test(QMap<QString,int> foo))
        SLOT(test(QMap<QString,int> foo, QMap<QString,int> bar))
        SLOT(test(QMap<QList<QString>,int> foo))
        SLOT(test(const QString &foo))
        SLOT(test(QString &foo))
        SLOT(test(const QMap<QList<QString>,int> &foo))
        SLOT(test(const QString &foo, int bar))
    \endcode

    Just like in Qt \l {Qt::ConnectionType} {queued connections} and QtRO
    SIGNALS, parameters in slots that are references will be copied when being
    passed to Replicas.

    \section3 ENUM

    Enumerations (which use a combination of C++ enum and Qt's Q_ENUM in QtRO)
    are described using the ENUM keyword.

    \code
        ENUM MyEnum {Foo}
        ENUM MyEnum {Foo, Bar}
        ENUM MyEnum {Foo, Bar = -1}
        ENUM MyEnum {Foo=-1, Bar}
        ENUM MyEnum {Foo=0xf, Bar}
        ENUM MyEnum {Foo=1, Bar=3, Bas=5}
    \endcode

    Related topics: \l {The ENUM type}, \l {USE_ENUM keyword}

    \section2 The POD type

    Plain Old Data (POD) is a term to describe a simple data collection, along
    the lines of a C++ struct. For example, if you have an API for a phonebook,
    you may want to use the concept of an "address" in its interface (where
    address might include street, city, state, country, and postal code). You
    can use the POD keyword to define objects like this, which can then be used
    by in PROP/SIGNAL/SLOT definitions in your class definitions.

    Usage is to declare \c POD followed by the name for the generated type,
    followed by type and name pairs separated by commas, where the type/name
    pairs are wrapped in parentheses.

    \code
        POD Foo(int bar)
        POD Foo(int bar, double bas)
        POD Foo(QMap<QString,int> bar)
        POD Foo(QList<QString> bar)
        POD Foo(QMap<QString,int> bar, QMap<double,int> bas)
    \endcode

    A full example would look like this
    \code
        POD Foo(QList<QString> bar)
        class MyType
        {
            SIGNAL(sendCustom(Foo foo));
        };
    \endcode

    The code generated by repc creates a Q_GADGET class for each POD, with
    corresponding Q_PROPERTY members for each type defined for the POD.

    \section2 The ENUM type

    It is often easier and cleaner to define an ENUM inside a class (see \l ENUM),
    but if you need a standalone enum type, using the ENUM keyword outside of a
    class definition can be helpful. This will generate a new class in your
    header files that handles marshalling, etc.. The syntax is identical to \l
    ENUM, with the exception that the declaration in this case is not contained
    in a \c class declaration.

    Related topics: \l {ENUM}, \l {USE_ENUM keyword}

    \section2 USE_ENUM keyword

    The USE_ENUM keyword was implemented before autogeneration via the ENUM
    keyword was added. It is kept for backwards compatibility.

    Related topics: \l {ENUM}, \l {The ENUM type}

    \section2 Directives

    The rep file defines an interface, but interfaces often require external
    elements. In order to support this, repc will include any (single line)
    directives at the top of the generated files. This allows you to, for
    instance, use #include or #define directives that support the logic or
    datatypes needed.

    The repc tool currently only everything from the "#" symbol to the
    end-of-line and adds that to the generated files. So multi-line
    #if/#else/#endif statements and multi-line macros are not supported.

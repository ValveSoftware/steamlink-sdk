\brief Information for implementing a new multimedia backend.

\section1 Overview

A multimedia backend provides the glue between platform-specific libraries, and
Qt Multimedia. In some cases the available cross-platform Multimedia APIs or
implementations are not sufficient, or not immediately available on a certain
platform. Alternatively, the multimedia implementation on a platform might expose
certain extra properties or functionality that other platforms do not, or a finer
degree of control might be possible.  For these cases, it is possible to use
extended controls directly.
\omit
In addition, if you plan to port the Qt Multimedia APIs to a new platform, you do
this by implementing certain control and service classes, as detailed below.

\section1 Extending the API

For the developer who wishes to extend the functionality of the Qt Multimedia
classes there are several classes of particular importance. The classes
providing default functionality are QMediaService, QMediaServiceProvider and
QMediaControl.  Some of these classes are not in the public API since they
are very seldom useful to application developers.

To extend the Multimedia API you would use the following three classes or
classes derived from them.

    \list
    \li QMediaServiceProvider is used by the top level client class to
    request a service. The top level class knowing what kind of service it needs.

    \li \l QMediaService provides a service and when asked by the top level
    object, say a component, will return a QMediaControl object.

    \li \l QMediaControl allows the control of the service using a known interface.
    \endlist

Consider a developer creating, for example, a media player class called MyPlayer.
It may have special requirements beyond ordinary media players and so may
need a custom service and a custom control. We can subclass QMediaServiceProvider
to create our MyServiceProvider class. Also we will create a
MyMediaService, and the MyMediaControl to manipulate the media service.

The MyPlayer object calls MyServiceProvider::requestService() to get an
instance of MyMediaService. Then the MyPlayer object calls this service
object it has just received and calling \l {QMediaService::requestControl()}{requestControl()}
it will receive the control object derived from QMediaControl.

Now we have all the parts necessary for our media application. We have the service
provider, the service it provides and the control used to manipulate the
service. Since our MyPlayer object has instances of the service and its
control then it would be possible for these to be used by associated classes
that could do additional actions, perhaps with their own control since the
parameter to requestControl() is a zero-terminated string, \e {const char *},
for the interface.

\section2 Adding a Media Service Provider

In general, adding a new media service provider is outside the scope of this documentation.
For best results, consult the existing provider source code, and seek assistance on the relevant
mailing lists and IRC channels.

The base class for creating new service providers is \l{QMediaServiceProvider}.
The user must implement the \l{QMediaServiceProvider::requestService()}{requestService()}
function

\code
    QMediaService* requestService(const QByteArray &type, const QMediaServiceProviderHint &hint);
\endcode

The details of implementation will depend on the provider. Looking at the
class \l QMediaServiceProvider for the default implementation. Notice that
\l {QMediaServiceProvider::requestService()}{requestService()} uses the
\l QMediaServiceProviderHint to look for the appropriate plugin and then to
insert it into the plugin map. However, for a specific service provider there
is probably no need for this approach, it will simply depend on what the
developer wants to implement.

Other methods that may be overloaded
\code
    void releaseService(QMediaService *service);

    QtMediaServices::SupportEstimate hasSupport(const QByteArray &serviceType,
                                        const QString &mimeType,
                                        const QStringList& codecs,
                                        int flags) const;

    QStringList supportedMimeTypes(const QByteArray &serviceType, int flags) const;

    QList<QByteArray> devices(const QByteArray &serviceType) const;

    QString deviceDescription(const QByteArray &serviceType, const QByteArray &device);
\endcode

The choice of what needs to be done depends on what the developer wishes to do with the service.

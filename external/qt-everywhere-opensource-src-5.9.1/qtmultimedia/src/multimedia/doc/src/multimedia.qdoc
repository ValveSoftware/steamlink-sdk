\title Multimedia
\brief A set of APIs for working with audio, video, radio and camera devices.

Multimedia support in Qt is provided by the \l{Qt Multimedia} module. The Qt
Multimedia module provides a rich feature set that enables you to easily take
advantage of a platform's multimedia capabilities such as media playback and
the use of camera and radio devices.

\section1 Features

Here are some examples of what can be done with Qt Multimedia APIs:

\list
\li Access raw audio devices for input and output
\li Play low latency sound effects
\li Play media files in playlists (such as compressed audio or video files)
\li Record audio and compress it
\li Tune and listen to radio stations
\li Use a camera, including viewfinder, image capture, and movie recording
\li Play 3D positional audio with \l{Qt Audio Engine QML Types}{Qt Audio Engine}
\li Decode audio media files into memory for processing
\li Accessing video frames or audio buffers as they are played or recorded
\endlist

\section1 Multimedia Components

Qt's multimedia APIs are categorized into four main components.  More
information (including background information and class references) is
available here:

\li \l {Audio Overview}
\li \l {Video Overview}
\li \l {Camera Overview}
\li \l {Radio Overview}
\endlist

\section1 Limitations

The Qt Multimedia APIs build upon the multimedia framework of the underlying
platform. This can mean that support for various codecs or containers can vary
between machines, depending on what the end user has installed.

\section1 Advanced Usage

For developers wishing to access some platform specific settings, or to port the
Qt Multimedia APIs to a new platform or technology, see \l{Multimedia Backend
Development}.

\section1 Changes from Previous Versions

If you previously used Qt Multimedia in Qt 4, or used Qt Multimedia Kit in
Qt Mobility, please see \l {Changes in Qt Multimedia} for more information on
what changed, and what you might need to change when porting code.

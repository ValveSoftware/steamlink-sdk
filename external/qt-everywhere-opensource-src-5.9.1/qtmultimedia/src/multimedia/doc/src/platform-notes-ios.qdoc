\title Qt Multimedia on iOS
\brief Platform notes for iOS

This page covers the availability of Qt Multimedia features on iOS.

\section1 Limitations

Since Qt Multimedia for iOS uses the camera, the \c Info.plist assigned to
QMAKE_INFO_PLIST in the project file must contain the key
\c NSCameraUsageDescription. Otherwise the application will
abort on startup. See Info.plist documentation from Apple for more information
regarding this key.

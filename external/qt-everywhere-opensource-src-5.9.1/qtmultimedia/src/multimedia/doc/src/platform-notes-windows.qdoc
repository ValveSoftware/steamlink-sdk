\title Qt Multimedia on Windows
\brief Platform notes for Windows

This page covers the availability of Qt Multimedia features on Windows.

\section1 Implementation

Qt Multimedia features for Windows are implemented in two plugins; one
using the Microsoft DirectShow API, and another using WMF (Windows Media
Foundation) framework. DirectShow API was introduced in Windows 98, and
gradually deprecated from Windows XP onwards. Media Foundation framework
was introduced in Windows Vista as a replacement for DirectShow and other
multimedia APIs. Consequently, WMF plugin in Qt is supported only for
Windows Vista and later versions of the operating system.

\section1 Limitations

The WMF plugin in Qt does not currently provide a camera backend. Instead,
limited support for camera features is provided by the DirectShow
plugin. Basic features such as displaying a viewfinder and capturing a
still image are supported, however, majority of camera controls are not
implemented.

Video recording is currently not supported. Additionally, the DirectShow
plugin does not support any low-level video functionality such as
monitoring video frames being played or recorded using \l QVideoProbe or
related classes.

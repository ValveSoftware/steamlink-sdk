Cupcakes
=============

### Ingredients

* 300 g caster sugar
* 150 ml sunflower oil
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 500 g dairy-free soya yoghurt
* 2 teaspoons cider vinegar
* 350 g plain flour
* 1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
* 1½ teaspoons baking powder

#### For the vegan vanilla icing
* 200 g dairy-free soya spread , chilled
* 660 g icing sugar
* ½ teaspoon vanilla extract

### Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 170°C fan/375°F/gas 5.
2. Place the sugar, oil and vanilla extract in a large bowl, then beat with an electric mixer for 1 to 2 minutes, until well combined.
3. Mix the yoghurt and vinegar together in a bowl, then add to the mixture and beat for 1 to 2 minutes.
4. Add the remaining cupcake ingredients and 1 teaspoon of fine sea salt, then whisk until smooth and just combined.
5. Fill the paper cases two-thirds full with mixture, but don’t bother to smooth it out.
6. Bake for 20 minutes, or until they spring back when touched. Leave to cool, transferring to a wire cooling rack after 5 minutes.
7. Meanwhile, make the icing. Beat the soya spread with an electric mixer for 1 to 2 minutes, or until smooth.
8. Sift the icing sugar into a large bowl, then add to the soya spread in two stages, beating well between each.
9. Add the vanilla extract and a small splash of water, then whisk for a further few minutes, or until silky smooth – if it’s too stiff, add a splash more water to loosen.
10. Once the cupcakes are cool, decorate them with the icing and add a few sprinkles too if you like – whatever takes your fancy – then enjoy.

**Enjoy!**

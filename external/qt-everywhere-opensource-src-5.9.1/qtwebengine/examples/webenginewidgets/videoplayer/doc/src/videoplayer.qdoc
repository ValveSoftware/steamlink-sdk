    \brief Displays full screen video using \l QWebEngineView

    \image videoplayer-example.png

    \e {Video Player} demonstrates how to support full screen playback of HTML5
    video using \l QWebEngineView.

    \l {https://fullscreen.spec.whatwg.org/}{The Fullscreen API} is a
    cross-browser Javascript API that enables a web page to request that one of
    its HTML elements be made to occupy the user's entire screen. It is
    commonly used for full screen video playback via the \c <video> element, but
    can in principle be used to display any HTML content in full screen mode. Qt
    WebEngine supports this API, however it is disabled by default. This example
    shows the steps needed to switch it on, including:

    \list
        \li Enabling it in \l QWebEngineSettings.
        \li Handling the \l QWebEnginePage::fullScreenRequested signal by creating
            a new full screen window.
        \li Displaying a notification popup to ensure that the user is aware
            that something is being displayed full screen.
    \endlist

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \section1 Overview

    Once started, the example program will create a normal (non-fullscreen)
    window with a \l QWebEngineView showing an embedded YouTube video player.
    You can then click on the full screen toggle button (bottom-right corner) to
    enter full screen mode. This should also display a centered notification
    overlay informing you that you can exit full screen mode by pressing the
    escape key.

    Implementation-wise entering full screen mode entails creating a new full
    screen window with a separate \l QWebEngineView instance and migrating the
    \l QWebEnginePage from the normal window's \l QWebEngineView to this new \l
    QWebEngineView. Exiting full screen mode reverses this migration.

    The example code is divided between three classes, \c MainWindow, \c
    FullScreenWindow, and \c FullScreenNotification. The classes \c MainWindow
    and \c FullScreenWindow are each responsible for managing one top-level
    window, while \c FullScreenNotification is responsible for styling and
    animating the notification box. A \c MainWindow is created on startup and
    lives for the entire program runtime, while a new \c FullScreenWindow is
    created every time full screen mode is entered.

    \section1 MainWindow Class Declaration

    A \c MainWindow is a \l QMainWindow with a \l QWebEngineView as the central
    widget:

    \quotefromfile webenginewidgets/videoplayer/mainwindow.h
    \skipto #include
    \printuntil /^\}/

    \section1 MainWindow Class Definition

    In the constructor we start by setting up the \l QWebEngineView as the
    central widget:

    \quotefromfile webenginewidgets/videoplayer/mainwindow.cpp
    \skipto MainWindow::MainWindow
    \printuntil setCentralWidget

    We then configure Qt WebEngine to advertise support for the Fullscreen API:

    \printline QWebEngineSettings

    Without this line the full screen toggle button would be disabled (grayed
    out) as the Javascript running on the page can detect that our browser
    does not support full screen mode.

    Next we connect the \c fullScreenRequested signal to our slot:

    \printuntil &MainWindow::fullScreenRequested

    This signal is emitted whenever the Javascript on the page wants to enter or
    exit full screen mode. Without handling this signal (but still keeping the
    \c FullScreenSupportEnabled attribute as \c true) the toggle button will be
    enabled but clicking on it will have no effect as Javascript's full screen
    request will be denied.

    Finally, we load some HTML (see
    \l{webenginewidgets/videoplayer/data/index.html}{index.html} included with
    the example) into our \l QWebEngineView:

    \printline load

    The second part of \c MainWindow is handling the full screen requests:

    \skipto MainWindow::fullScreenRequested
    \printuntil /^\}/

    We create a new \c FullScreenWindow when entering full screen mode, and
    delete it when exiting.

    \section1 FullScreenWindow Class Declaration

    A \c FullScreenWindow is a \l QWidget containing a \l QWebEngineView and a
    \c FullScreenNotification.

    \quotefromfile webenginewidgets/videoplayer/fullscreenwindow.h
    \skipto #include
    \printuntil /^\}/

    \section1 FullScreenWindow Class Definition

    The constructor is responsible for hiding the normal window (while saving
    its geometry) and showing the new \c FullScreenWindow instead:

    \quotefromfile webenginewidgets/videoplayer/fullscreenwindow.cpp
    \skipto FullScreenWindow::FullScreenWindow
    \printuntil /^\}/

    The call to \l QWebEngineView::setPage will move the web page from the \c
    MainWindow's view to \c FullScreenWindow's view.

    In the destructor we use the same method to move the page back, after which
    we restore the main window's geometry and visibility:

    \skipto FullScreenWindow::~FullScreenWindow
    \printuntil /^\}/

    We override \l QWidget::resizeEvent to do manual layout, keeping the \l
    QWebEngineView maximized, and the \c FullScreenNotification centered within
    the window:

    \skipto FullScreenWindow::resizeEvent
    \printuntil /^\}/

    \section1 FullScreenNotification Class Declaration

    A \c FullScreenNotification is just a \l QLabel with some styling and
    animation:

    \quotefromfile webenginewidgets/videoplayer/fullscreennotification.h
    \skipto #include
    \printuntil /^\}/

    \section1 FullScreenWindow Class Definition

    In the constructor we configure the QLabel and set up a delayed fade-out
    animation using \l {The Animation Framework}:

    \quotefromfile webenginewidgets/videoplayer/fullscreennotification.cpp
    \skipto FullScreenNotification::FullScreenNotification
    \printuntil /^\}/

    The custom signal \c shown, which we use to trigger the animation, is
    emitted from the \c showEvent method:

    \skipto FullScreenNotification::showEvent
    \printuntil /^\}/

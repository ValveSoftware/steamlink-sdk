    \title Deploying Qt WebEngine Applications

    The way to package and deploy applications varies between operating systems.
    For Windows and \macos, \l{The Windows Deployment Tool}{windeployqt} and
    \l{Deploying Applications on macOS}{macdeployqt} automate the steps to
    generate a stand-alone application package.

    When manually deploying applications that depend on Qt WebEngine, all the
    files that are required to run the application have to be included:
    libraries, QML imports, plugins, and translations.

    For more information, see \l {Deploying Qt Applications}.

    \section1 Target Platforms

    Qt WebEngine does try to support all \l{Supported Platforms} of Qt. However,
    due to different requirements of Chromium this is not always possible. Known
    limitations are:

    \list
        \li Qt WebEngine currently supports only Windows, Linux, and \macos.

        \li On Windows, Qt WebEngine only supports Windows Vista or newer as
            target platform. Due to use of newer API in Chromium, Windows XP is
            not supported. WinRT is not supported, either.
    \endlist

    \section1 Deploying Applications Manually

    When  manually deploying applications that depend on Qt WebEngine, the
    following files might have to be deployed:

    \list
        \li Libraries
        \li QML imports
        \li Qt WebEngine process
        \li Resources
        \li Translations
        \li Audio and video codecs
    \endlist

    \section2 Deploying Libraries

    The following libraries must be deployed with applications that depend on
    Qt WebEngine:

    \list
        \li QtWebEngineCore library
        \li QtWebEngineWidgets or QtWebEngine libraries, depending on
            application type
    \endlist

    \section2 Deploying QML Imports

    If Qt Quick integration is used in the application, the QtWebEngine import
    directory needs to be deployed.

    \section2 Deploying Qt WebEngine Processes

    Qt WebEngine takes advantage of the multi-process model that the Chromium
    project offers. The multi-process model requires that the Qt WebEngine
    Process executable be deployed alongside your application.

    The WebEngine process is executed for each QWebEngineView or WebEngineView
    instance. For example, a browser application
    with two tabs open should have two separate instances of the process
    running. This is a common approach used by most modern web engines to
    provide a stable browsing experience.

    At runtime, Qt WebEngine looks for the \c QtWebEngineProcess executable in
    the directory that
    QLibraryInfo::location(QLibraryInfo::LibraryExecutablesPath) returns.
    For Qt installations, this is \c QTDIR/libexec (Linux) or \c QTDIR\bin
    (Windows). The path can be changed by defining a \c qt.conf file, for
    example. Alternatively, an executable path can be set as a value of the
    \c QTWEBENGINEPROCESS_PATH environment variable. On \macos, Qt WebEngine
    looks for the executable in \c .app/Helpers/QtWebEngineProcess.

    \section2 Deploying Resources

    Qt WebEngine requires the following resource files:

    \list
        \li \c qtwebengine_resources.pak contains the resources needed by
            Chromium.
        \li \c qtwebengine_devtools_resources.pak contains tools for remote
            debugging.
        \li \c qtwebengine_resources_100p.pak contains images suitable for low
            resolution displays.
        \li \c qtwebengine_resources_200p.pak contains images suitable for high
            DPI displays.
        \li \c icudtl.dat provides support for International Components for
            Unicode (ICU). It is the Chromium version of ICU, which is not
            needed if Qt WebEngine was configured to use the system ICU.
    \endlist

    Resources are searched from the following locations:

    \list
        \li On Linux and Windows: the \c resources directory in the directory
            specified by QLibraryInfo::location(QLibraryInfo::DataPath)
        \li On \macos: \c .app/Content/Resources
    \endlist

    \section2 Translations

    Locale data (such as \c en-US.pak) is searched form the following locations:

    \list
        \li On \macos: \c .app/Content/Resources
        \li On Linux and Windows: \c qtwebengine_locales directory in the
            directory specified by
            QLibraryInfo::location(QLibraryInfo::TranslationsPath)
    \endlist

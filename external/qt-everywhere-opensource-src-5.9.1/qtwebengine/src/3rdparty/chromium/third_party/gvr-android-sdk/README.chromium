Description:
The Google VR SDK for Android supports both Daydream and Cardboard, including a
simple API used for creating apps inserted into Cardboard viewers, and the more
complex API for supporting Daydream-ready phones and the Daydream controller.

Local Modifications:
Only header files in NDK are used. Due to binary size concern, we have decided
to use a static shim library instead of the shared library that comes with
this checkout. The static libraries are downloaded from a public storage through
gclient sync. Currently, the static libraries needs a newer version of
common_library.aar than the one provided by this checkout. So we also download
it from the same public storage. Once the version on github catches up, we will
remove common_library.aar.
All JNI calls in the static library also needs to be manually registered. So
we have 3 jni related files. These files were generated by
base/android/jni_generator/jni_generator.py from Java files. Modifications to
these generated files are documented in the files.

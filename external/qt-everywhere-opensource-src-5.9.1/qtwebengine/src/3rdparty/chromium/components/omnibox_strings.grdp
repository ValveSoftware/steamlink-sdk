  <message name="IDS_SECURE_VERBOSE_STATE" desc="An adjective or short adjective phrase shown next to the green lock icon in the omnibox to describe a secure site (valid HTTPS connection). Note that 'secure' in this case primarily refers to HTTPS connection security, so prefer translations with a connotation of 'private' (no one can intercept your communication with the site) rather than 'trustworthy' (which would be a judgment of site reputation).

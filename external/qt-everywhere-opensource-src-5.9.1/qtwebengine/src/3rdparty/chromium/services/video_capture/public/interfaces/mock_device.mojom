// that expected calls to this interface are made by the service implementation.
// The Mojo equivalent is needed to allow such tests across the Mojo boundary.
// This interface contains only simplified versions of the methods from
// media::VideoCaptureDevice that we actually verify in tests.
//
// Similar to video_capture.mojom.Device, this interface is an abstraction of a
// device, but the purpose of the two interfaces is quite different.
// video_capture.mojom.Device is for production clients of the Mojo service to
// interact with the devices. MockMediaDevice is for tests of the Mojo
// service to allow verification of calls of the service made to instances of
// media::VideoCaptureDevice.
//
// Instances can be added to the mock factory provided by the
// video_capture.mojom.Service.

  //
  //  connector_request
  //    An optional Connector request for the service manager to bind, allowing
  //    the initialized client to connect to others.
  //
  //  control_request
  //    An optional associated ServiceControl request.

  // documentation in service_manager.mojom for Connect(). The service
  // originating the request is referred to as the "source" and the one
  // receiving the "target".
  //
  // The Service must respond to acknowledge receipt of the request.
  //
  // Parameters:
  //
  //  source_info
  //    Contains the source identity and interface provider specs.
  //
  //  interfaces
  //    A request for an InterfaceProvider by which the source service may
  //    seek to bind interface implementations exported by the target.

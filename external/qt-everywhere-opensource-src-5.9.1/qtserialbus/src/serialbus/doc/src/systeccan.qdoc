    \title Using SystecCAN Backend

    \brief Overview of how to use the SystecCAN backend.

    The SystecCAN backend encapsulates the low-level API to work with the
    \l{http://www.systec-electronic.com/}{SYS TEC} CAN adapters.

    This plugin requires the SYS TEC CAN device drivers and the usbcan32.dll
    (usbcan64.dll for 64 bit builds).

    \section1 Creating CAN Bus Devices

    At first it is necessary to check that QCanBus provides the desired backend:

    \code
        if (QCanBus::instance()->plugins().contains(QStringLiteral("systeccan"))) {
            // backend available
        }
    \endcode

    Where \e systeccan is the backend name.

    Next, a connection to a specific interface can be established:

    \code
        QCanBusDevice *device = QCanBus::instance()->createDevice(
            QStringLiteral("systeccan"), QStringLiteral("can0.0"));
        device->connectDevice();
    \endcode

    Where, \e can0.0 is the active CAN interface name (interface 0, channel 0).
    The SystecCAN backend supports 64 USB interfaces (so called modules) from
    \e can0.0 to \e can63.1. Each module can have one or two channels, they can
    be accessed by the index canX.0 or canX.1.

    \note SYS TEC also provides 8 or 16 channel CAN interfaces. These units
    consist of an USB hub and multiple two-channel modules internally.

    The device is now open for writing and reading CAN frames:

    \code
        QCanBusFrame frame;
        frame.setFrameId(8);
        QByteArray payload("A36E");
        frame.setPayload(payload);
        device->writeFrame(frame);
    \endcode

    The reading can be done using the \l {QCanBusDevice::}{readFrame()} method.
    The \l {QCanBusDevice::}{framesReceived()} signal is emitted when at least
    one new frame is available for reading:

    \code
        QCanBusFrame frame = device->readFrame();
    \endcode

    SystecCAN supports the following configurations that can be controlled through
    \l {QCanBusDevice::}{setConfigurationParameter()}:

    \table
        \header
            \li Configuration parameter key
            \li Description
        \row
            \li QCanBusDevice::BitRateKey
            \li Determines the bit rate of the CAN bus connection. The following bit rates
                are supported: 10000, 20000, 50000, 100000, 125000, 250000, 500000, 800000,
                and 1000000. Note that this configuration parameter can only be adjusted
                while the QCanBusDevice is not connected.
        \row
            \li QCanBusDevice::ReceiveOwnKey
            \li The reception of CAN frames on the same channel that was sending the CAN frame
                is disabled by default.
   \endtable

    \title Custom Proxy Example
    \ingroup qtdatavisualization_examples
    \brief Using Q3DBars with a custom proxy.

    The custom proxy example shows how to create a custom proxy to use with Q3DBars.

    \image customproxy-example.png

    The interesting thing about custom proxy example is the custom dataset and the corresponding
    proxy usage, so we concentrate on that and skip explaining the basic Q3DBars functionality
    - for that see \l{Bars Example}.

    This example defines a simple flexible data set \c VariantDataSet where each data item is a
    a variant list. Each item can have multiple different values, identified by their index in
    the list. In this example, the data set is storing monthly rainfall data, where the value in
    index zero is the year, the value in index one is the month, and the value in index two is
    the amount of rainfall in that month.

    The custom proxy we provide here is similar to item model based proxies provided by Qt
    Data Visualization in that it requires a mapping to interpret the data.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \section1 VariantDataSet

    \c VariantDataSet class provides a simple API:

    \snippet customproxy/variantdataset.h 1
    \dots 0
    \codeline
    \snippet customproxy/variantdataset.h 0

    As you can see, the data items are simply QVariantList objects, and the data can be added either
    singly or in lists. The only additional functionality provided is clearing the data set and querying
    for a reference to the data contained in the set. Signals are emitted when data is added or the set
    is cleared.

    \section1 VariantBarDataProxy

    \c VariantBarDataProxy is a subclass of QBarDataProxy and provides a simple API of just getters
    and setters for the data set and the mapping:

    \snippet customproxy/variantbardataproxy.h 0
    \dots 0
    \codeline
    \snippet customproxy/variantbardataproxy.h 1

    On the implementation side, the proxy listens for the changes in the data set and the mapping,
    and resolves the data set if any changes are detected. It is not particularly efficient
    implementation in that any change will cause re-resolving of the entire data set, but that is not
    an issue for this example. The interesting part is the \c resolveDataSet() method:

    \snippet customproxy/variantbardataproxy.cpp 0

    In \c resolveDataSet() method we sort the variant data values into rows and columns based on the
    mapping. This is very similar to how QItemModelBarDataProxy handles mapping, except we use
    list indexes instead of item model roles here. Once the values are sorted, we generate \c QBarDataArray
    out of them, and call \c resetArray() method on the parent class.

    \section1 VariantBarDataMapping

    \c VariantBarDataMapping stores the mapping information between \c VariantDataSet data item indexes
    and rows, columns, and values of \c QBarDataArray. It also contains the lists of rows and columns to
    be included in the resolved data:

    \snippet customproxy/variantbardatamapping.h 0
    \dots 0
    \codeline
    \snippet customproxy/variantbardatamapping.h 1
    \dots 0
    \codeline
    \snippet customproxy/variantbardatamapping.h 2
    \dots 0
    \codeline
    \snippet customproxy/variantbardatamapping.h 3

    The primary way to use a \c VariantBarDataMapping object is to give the mappings already at the
    constructor, though they can be set later individually or all together with the \c remap() method.
    A signal is emitted if mapping changes. It is basically a simplified version of the mapping
    functionality of QItemModelBarDataProxy adapted to work with variant lists instead of item models.

    \section1 RainfallGraph

    \c RainfallGraph class handles the setup of the graph. The interesting part is the \c addDataSet()
    method:

    \snippet customproxy/rainfallgraph.cpp 0

    The bulk of that method is used for populating the variant data set. Once the set is populated,
    visualizing the data is trivial with the help of our custom proxy:

    \snippet customproxy/rainfallgraph.cpp 1

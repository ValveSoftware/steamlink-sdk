    \brief Rendering volumetric objects.
    \since QtDataVisualization 1.2

    This example shows how to use QCustom3DVolume items to display volumetric data.

    \section1 Initializing Volume Item

    The QCustom3DVolume items are special custom items (see QCustom3DItem), which can be used
    to display volumetric data. The volume items are only supported with orthographic projection,
    so first we make sure the graph is using it:

    \snippet volumetric/volumetric.cpp 6

    The following code shows how to create a volumetric item tied to the data ranges of the axes:

    \snippet volumetric/volumetric.cpp 0

    By setting the QCustom3DItem::scalingAbsolute property to \c{false}, we indicate that the
    scaling of the volume should follow the changes in the data ranges. Next we define the
    internal contents of the volume:

    \snippet volumetric/volumetric.cpp 1

    We use eight bit indexed color for our texture, as it is compact and makes it easy to adjust the
    colors without needing to reset the whole texture. For the texture data we use the data we
    created earlier based on some height maps.
    Typically the data for volume items comes pregenerated in a form of a stack of images, so we are
    not going to explain the data generation in detail. Please refer to the example code if you
    are interested in the actual data generation process.

    Since we are using eight bit indexed colors, we need a color table to map the eight bit color
    indexes to actual colors. We use one we populated on our own, but in a typical use case you
    would get the color table from the source images:

    \snippet volumetric/volumetric.cpp 2

    We want to optionally show slice frames around the volume, so we initialize their properties.
    Initially, the frames will be hidden:

    \snippet volumetric/volumetric.cpp 5

    Finally we add the volume as a custom item to the graph to display it:

    \snippet volumetric/volumetric.cpp 3

    \section1 Slicing into the Volume

    Unless the volume is largely transparent, you can only see the surface of it, which is often
    not very helpful. One way to inspect the internal structure of the volume is to view the slices
    of the volume. QCustom3DVolume provides two ways to display the slices. The first is to show
    the selected slices in place of the volume. For example, to specify a slice perpendicular to
    the X-axis, you can use the following method:

    \snippet volumetric/volumetric.cpp 7

    To actually draw the slice specified above, the QCustom3DVolume::drawSlices property must be
    also set:

    \snippet volumetric/volumetric.cpp 8

    The second way to view slices is to use QCustom3DVolume::renderSlice() method, which produces
    a QImage from the specified slice. This image can then be displayed on another widget, such
    as a QLabel here:

    \snippet volumetric/volumetric.cpp 9

    \section1 Adjusting Volume Transparency

    Sometimes viewing just the slices doesn't give you a good understanding of the volume's internal
    structure. QCustom3DVolume provides two properties that can be used to adjust the volume
    transparency:

    \snippet volumetric/volumetric.cpp 11
    \dots
    \snippet volumetric/volumetric.cpp 10

    The QCustom3DVolume::alphaMultiplier is a general multiplier that is applied to the alpha value
    of each voxel of the volume. It makes it possible to add uniform transparency to the already
    somewhat transparent portions of the volume to reveal internal opaque details. This multiplier
    doesn't affect colors that are fully opaque, unless the QCustom3DVolume::preserveOpacity
    property is set to \c{false}.

    An alternative way to adjust the transparency of the volume is adjust the alpha values of the
    voxels directly. For eight bit indexed textures, this is done simply by modifying and
    resetting the color table:

    \snippet volumetric/volumetric.cpp 12

    \section1 High Definition vs. Low Definition Shader

    By default the volume rendering uses the high definition shader. It accounts for each
    voxel of the volume with correct weight when ray-tracing the volume contents,
    providing an accurate representation of even the finer details of the volume.
    However, this is computationally very expensive, so the frame rate suffers.
    If rendering speed is more important than pixel-perfect
    accuracy of the volume contents, you can take the much faster low definition shader into use
    by setting \c{false} for QCustom3DVolume::useHighDefShader property. The low definition shader
    achieves the speed by making compromises on the accuracy, so it doesn't guarantee each voxel
    of the volume will be sampled. This can lead to flickering and/or other rendering artifacts
    on the finer details of the volume.

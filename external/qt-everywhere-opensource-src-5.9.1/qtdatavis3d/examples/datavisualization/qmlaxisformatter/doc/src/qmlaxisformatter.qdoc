    \title Qt Quick 2 Axis Formatter Example
    \ingroup qtdatavisualization_examples
    \brief Example of a hybrid C++ and QML application demonstrating different axis formatters.
    \since QtDataVisualization 1.1

    The Qt Quick axis formatter example shows how to use predefined axis formatters and how to
    create a custom one.

    The interesting thing about this example is axis formatters, so we'll concentrate on
    that and skip explaining the basic functionality - for
    more detailed QML example documentation, see \l{Qt Quick 2 Scatter Example}.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \section1 Custom Axis Formatter

    Customizing axis formatters requires subclassing the QValue3DAxisFormatter, which cannot be
    done in QML code alone. In this example we want an axis that interprets the float values as
    a timestamp and shows the date in the axis labels. To achieve this, we introduce a new class
    called \c CustomFormatter, which subclasses the QValue3DAxisFormatter:

    \snippet qmlaxisformatter/customformatter.h 2
    \dots 0

    Since float values of a QScatter3DSeries cannot be directly cast into QDateTime values due to
    difference in data width, we need some sort of mapping between the two. We chose to do the
    mapping by specifying an origin date for the formatter and interpreting the float values
    from the QScatter3DSeries as date offsets to that origin value. The origin date is given as
    a property:

    \snippet qmlaxisformatter/customformatter.h 1

    The mapping from value to QDateTime is done using \c valueToDateTime() method:

    \snippet qmlaxisformatter/customformatter.cpp 0

    To function as an axis formatter, our \c CustomFormatter needs to reimplement some virtual
    methods:

    \snippet qmlaxisformatter/customformatter.h 0

    The first two are simple, we just create a new instance of \c CustomFormatter and copy the
    necessary data over to it. These two methods are used to create and update a cache of formatter for
    rendering purposes. It is important to remember to call the superclass implementation
    of \c populateCopy():

    \snippet qmlaxisformatter/customformatter.cpp 1

    Bulk of the work done by \c CustomFormatter is done in the \c recalculate() method, where
    our formatter calculates the grid, subgrid, and label positions, as well as formats the label
    strings.
    In our custom formatter we ignore the segment count of the axis and draw a grid line always at
    midnight. Subsegment count and label positioning is handled normally:

    \snippet qmlaxisformatter/customformatter.cpp 2

    The axis labels are formatted to show only the date, but for selection label we want little more
    resolution for the timestamp, so we specify another property for our custom formatter to allow
    user to customize it:

    \snippet qmlaxisformatter/customformatter.h 3

    This selection format property is used in the reimplemented \c stringToValue method, where we
    ignore the submitted format and substitute the custom selection format for it:

    \snippet qmlaxisformatter/customformatter.cpp 3

    To expose our new custom formatter to the QML, we must declare and register it:

    \snippet qmlaxisformatter/main.cpp 0
    \dots 0
    \snippet qmlaxisformatter/main.cpp 1

    \section1 QML

    In the QML codes, we define a different axis for each dimension:

    \snippet qmlaxisformatter/qml/qmlaxisformatter/main.qml 3

    Z-axis is just a regular ValueAxis3D:

    \snippet qmlaxisformatter/qml/qmlaxisformatter/main.qml 0

    For the Y-axis we define a logarithmic axis. ValueAxis3D can be made to show logarithmic scale
    by specifying LogValueAxis3DFormatter for \c formatter property of the axis:

    \snippet qmlaxisformatter/qml/qmlaxisformatter/main.qml 2

    And finally, for the X-axis we use our new \c CustomFormatter:

    \snippet qmlaxisformatter/qml/qmlaxisformatter/main.qml 1

    Rest of the application consists of fairly self-explanatory logic for modifying the axes and
    showing the graph.

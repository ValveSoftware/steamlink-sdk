    \title Qt Data Visualization
    \page qtdatavisualization-index.html
    \brief Provides functionality for 3D visualization.


    Qt Data Visualization module provides a way to visualize data in 3D as bar,
    scatter, and surface graphs. It is especially useful for visualizing depth
    maps and large quantities of rapidly changing data, such as data received
    from multiple sensors. The look and feel of graphs can be customized
    by using themes or by adding custom items and labels to them.

    Qt Data Visualization is built on Qt 5 and OpenGL to take advantage of
    hardware acceleration and Qt Quick 2.

    \section1 Getting Started

    To import Qt Data Visualization QML types, add the following import statement to your \c .qml
    file:

    \snippet doc_src_qmldatavisualization.cpp 0

    If you intend to use Qt Data Visualization C++ classes in your application, use the
    following include and using directives:

    \snippet doc_src_qtdatavisualization.cpp 0

    \note If you are only using a few classes from this module, we recommend including only those
    specific classes instead of the whole module.

    To link against the Qt Data Visualization module, add this line to your \c qmake project file:

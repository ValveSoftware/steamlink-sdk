 * \class QItemModelSurfaceDataProxy
 * \inmodule QtDataVisualization
 * \brief Proxy class for presenting data in item models with Q3DSurface.
 * \since QtDataVisualization 1.0
 *
 * QItemModelSurfaceDataProxy allows you to use QAbstractItemModel derived models as a data source
 * for Q3DSurface. It uses the defined mappings to map data from the model to rows, columns, and
 * surface points of Q3DSurface graph.
 *
 * Data is resolved asynchronously whenever the mapping or the model changes.
 * QSurfaceDataProxy::arrayReset() is emitted when the data has been resolved.
 * However, when useModelCategories property is set to \c true, single item changes are resolved
 * synchronously, unless the same frame also contains a change that causes the whole model to be
 * resolved.
 *
 * Mappings can be used in the following ways:
 *
 * \list
 * \li If useModelCategories property is set to \c true, this proxy will map rows and
 *    columns of QAbstractItemModel to rows and columns of Q3DSurface, and uses the value returned for
 *    Qt::DisplayRole as Y-position by default. Row and column headers are used for Z-position and
 *    X-position by default, if they can be converted to floats. Otherwise row and column indices
 *    are used.
 *    The Y-position role to be used can be redefined if Qt::DisplayRole is not suitable.
 *    The Z-position and X-position roles to be used can be redefined if the headers or indices
 *    are not suitable.
 *
 * \li For models that do not have data already neatly sorted into rows and columns, such as
 *    QAbstractListModel based models, you can define a role from the model to map for each of row,
 *    column and Y-position.
 *
 * \li If you do not want to include all data contained in the model, or the autogenerated rows and
 *    columns are not ordered as you wish, you can specify which rows and columns should be included
 *    and in which order by defining an explicit list of categories for either or both of rows and
 *    columns.
 * \endlist
 *
 * For example, assume that you have a custom QAbstractItemModel storing surface topography data.
 * Each item in the model has the roles "longitude", "latitude", and "height".
 * The item model already contains the data properly sorted so that longitudes and latitudes are
 * first encountered in correct order, which enables us to utilize the row and column category
 * autogeneration.
 * You could do the following to display the data in a surface graph:
 *
 * \snippet doc_src_qtdatavisualization.cpp 5
 *
 * If the fields of the model do not contain the data in the exact format you need, you can specify
 * a search pattern regular expression and a replace rule for each role to get the value in a
 * format you need. For more information how the replace using regular expressions works, see
 * QString::replace(const QRegExp &rx, const QString &after) function documentation. Note that
 * using regular expressions has an impact on the performance, so it's more efficient to utilize
 * item models where doing search and replace is not necessary to get the desired values.
 *
 * For example about using the search patterns in conjunction with the roles, see
 * ItemModelBarDataProxy usage in \l{Qt Quick 2 Bars Example}.

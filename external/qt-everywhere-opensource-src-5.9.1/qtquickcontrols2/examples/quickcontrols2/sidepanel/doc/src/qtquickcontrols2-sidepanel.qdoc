    \title Qt Quick Controls 2 - Side Panel
    \ingroup qtquickcontrols2-examples
    \brief A non-closable persistent side panel with Drawer.

    This example demonstrates how \l Drawer can be used as a non-closable
    persistent side panel.

    \raw HTML
    <div class="table"><table style="background:transparent; border:0px">
    <tr><td style="border:0px">
    \endraw
    \image qtquickcontrols2-sidepanel-portrait.png
    \caption An interactive Drawer in portrait mode
    \raw HTML
    </td><td style="border:0px">
    \endraw
    \image qtquickcontrols2-sidepanel-landscape.png
    \caption A non-interactive Drawer in landscape mode
    \raw HTML
    </td></tr>
    </table></div>
    \endraw

    When the application is in portrait mode, the drawer is an interactive
    side panel that can be swiped open from the left edge. It appears on
    top of the content, and blocks user interaction through its modal
    background. When the application is in landscape mode, the drawer and
    the content are laid out side by side.

    The current orientation of the application is determined by comparing
    the width and height of the window:

    \snippet sidepanel/sidepanel.qml orientation

    This is used to specify whether the drawer is \l {Popup::}{modal} and
    \l {Drawer::}{interactive}, and to configure its \l {Drawer::}{position}
    and \l {Popup::visible}{visibility} accordingly.

    \quotefromfile sidepanel/sidepanel.qml
    \skipto Drawer
    \printline Drawer
    \dots 8
    \codeline
    \skipto modal
    \printuntil visible
    \dots 8
    \skipuntil ScrollIndicator
    \skipuntil }
    \printline }

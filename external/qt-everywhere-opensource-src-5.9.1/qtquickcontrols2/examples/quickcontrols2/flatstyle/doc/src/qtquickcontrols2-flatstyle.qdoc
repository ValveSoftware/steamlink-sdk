    \title Qt Quick Controls 2 - Flat Style
    \ingroup qtquickcontrols2-examples
    \brief A QML app using Qt Quick Controls 2 and a QML plugin
    with customized controls.

    \e Flat Style shows how to integrate customized controls into Qt Quick Designer.
    The example uses a pure QML plugin to define constants in a singleton. For the
    declarative parts of the UI, \c .ui.qml files are used. These can be edited
    visually in Qt Quick Designer.

    \section1 QML Plugin

    The example contains a plugin called Theme. The plugin consists of a QML file
    \c Theme.qml and a \c qmldir file. The plugin is located in the imports subdirectory
    and added as a resource.
    To ensure the plugin is found by QML, we add the import directory to the import
    paths of the engine in \c main.cpp.

    \code
    ...
    engine.addImportPath(":/imports");
    ...
    \endcode

    To ensure the code model and Qt Quick Designer can find the plugin, we add the following
    line to \e flatstyle.pro.

    \code
    QML_IMPORT_PATH = $$PWD/imports
    \endcode

    All colors, font parameters, and size constants that are used in this example
    are defined as properties in the singleton called \e Theme.qml.
    Usually such attribute values are defined as constants as they are not suppose to change at run time.
    In this example, we allow the user to change some attributes like the main color, the size parameter,
    and some font parameters while the application is running.

    Defining these attribute values in a singleton makes it easy to maintain and change them.
    This pattern makes it easy to implement theming.

    \section1 Implementing Custom Controls

    The plugin also contains a style for a couple of controls that implement a custom look and feel.
    This style is located in \c Flat and is set as the style for the application in \c qtquickcontrols2.conf.

    The example uses the states of a Qt Quick Item to implement the different states of a control.
    This has the advantage that we can define the custom look in Qt Quick Designer and we can easily
    verify the different states of a control.
    To edit the indicator of a switch in Qt Quick Designer we can open Switch.qml and then enter the implementation
    of the indicator called \c switchHandle using the combo box on the top next to the combo box for the open documents.

    The application itself is just a simple form that allows the user to adjust a couple of parameters of the custom controls.
    The user can choose another main color, set the font to bold or underline, and increase the size of the controls by
    toggling a switch.

    \e MainForm.ui.qml is just the pure declarative definition of the form, while \e flatstyle.qml instantiates the form
    and implements the logic.

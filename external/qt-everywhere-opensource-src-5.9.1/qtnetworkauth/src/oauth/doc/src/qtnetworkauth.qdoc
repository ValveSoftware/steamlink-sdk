    \title Qt Network Authorization
    \brief Provides network authorization capabilities (OAuth).

    Qt Network Authorization provides a set of APIs that enable Qt
    applications to obtain limited access to online accounts and
    HTTP services without exposing users' passwords.

    Currently, the supported authorization protocol is \l {https://oauth.net}
    {OAuth}, versions 1 and 2.

    \section1 Getting Started

//! [qtnetworkauth-usage]
    To use Qt Network Authorization classes, add this directive into C++ files:

    \code
    #include <QtNetworkAuth>
    \endcode

    To link against the Qt Network Authorization module, add this line to the
    project file:

    \code
    QT += network networkauth
    \endcode
//! [qtnetworkauth-usage]

    \section1 Overview

    The goal of this module is to provide a way to handle different
    authentication methods present on the Internet.

    There are several authentication systems, including:

    \list
      \li \l {https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849} {OAuth 1}
      \li \l {https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749} {OAuth 2}
      \li \l {http://openid.net} {OpenID}
      \li \l {http://openid.net/connect/} {OpenID Connect}
      \li \l {https://developer.mozilla.org/Persona} {Mozilla Persona}
    \endlist

    These systems allow the application developers to create applications which
    use external authentication servers provided by an
    \e {Authorization Server}.
    Users of these services need not worry about passing their credentials to
    suspicious applications. Instead, the credentials are entered in a known
    and trusted web interface.

\title QML Poster Example
\brief A QML example about reading and displaying NFC Data Exchange Format (NDEF) messages.

The QML Poster example displays the contents of specifically formatted NFC Data
Exchange Format (NDEF) messages read from an NFC Tag. The NDEF message must
contain a URI record, an optional \c image/* MIME record, and one or more
localized Text records.

\section1 Applying NDEF Filters

The example is designed to display the content of a very specific type of NFC tag.
The tag must contain at least one URI record and one text record. If those two
record types do not exist, nothing will happen. Such filtering is applied via the
\l NearField type's filter property. The property accepts a list of \l NdefFilter objects.

\section1 Processing Found NDEF Messages

Once an appropriate tag is found, the \l NearField::messageRecords property reflects the content.
It transports the list of found NDEF records. The QML snippet below
demonstrates how these records can be accessed:

\snippet poster/poster.qml messageRecordsChanged 1
\snippet poster/poster.qml messageRecordsChanged 2
\snippet poster/poster.qml messageRecordsChanged 3

\sa {Qt NFC}

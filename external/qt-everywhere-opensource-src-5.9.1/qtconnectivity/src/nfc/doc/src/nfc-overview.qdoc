\title Qt NFC Overview
\page qtnfc-overview.html
\brief Provides access to NFC enabled devices.

\tableofcontents

With the Qt NFC API typical use cases are:

\list
    \li Detecting NFC tags.
    \li Reading and writing NDEF messages.
    \li Registering NDEF message handlers.
    \li Sharing files and messages.
\endlist

The following sections describe how to use Qt NFC C++ classes and QML types for the above use cases.

\note On Android, Qt Nfc only works in foreground applications. Android services are not supported which is due to
API limitations on the Android side.

\section1 C++ Overview

The C++ API provides access to the full feature set of the Qt NFC API. This section introduces the
major features available to developers.

\section2 Detecting NFC Tags

The \l QNearFieldManager class is responsible for the detection of new NFC tags coming
into range of the device. The \l QNearFieldManager::targetDetected() and
\l QNearFieldManager::targetLost() signals are emitted when
a tag comes into or leaves the range. The passed \l QNearFieldTarget parameter acts
as primary interaction point for each detected tag. The detection does not actually start though until
\l QNearFieldManager::startTargetDetection() has been called.

\snippet ndefeditor/mainwindow.cpp QNearFieldManager init
\snippet ndefeditor/mainwindow.cpp QNearFieldManager start detection

Finally the detection can be stopped:

\snippet ndefeditor/mainwindow.cpp QNearFieldManager stop detection

Although each \l QNearFieldTarget instance is owned by its related \l QNearFieldManager
instance it can be beneficial to manually delete each instance. Otherwise they would continue to
exist until the \l QNearFieldManager instance is deleted. The best way to do that would be in response
to the \l QNearFieldManager::targetLost() signal:

\snippet ndefeditor/mainwindow.cpp QNearFieldTarget lost

\note The target object should only be deleted via deleteLater() if it is deleted inside the slot.

\section2 Reading and Writing NDEF Messages

The \l QNearFieldTarget instance returned by \l QNearFieldManager::targetDetected() signal
is used to interact with the tag. Reading and writing a message is an asynchronous operation.
The \l QNearFieldTarget::RequestId class associates individual operations and their results.

\snippet ndefeditor/mainwindow.cpp QNearFieldTarget detected

Once the \l QNearFieldTarget::readNdefMessages() request was successfully processed, the
\l QNearFieldTarget::ndefMessageRead() signal is emitted. Each returned \l QNdefMessage
may consist of zero or more \l QNdefRecord entries, which can be identified by their type.
For more information about processing of records, see the \l QNdefRecord class documentation.
As the above code demonstrates, writing of NDEF messages is triggered via
\l QNearFieldTarget::writeNdefMessages(). The successful completion of the write operation
is indicated by the emission of the \l QNearFieldTarget::ndefMessagesWritten() signal. Any
type of error during read or write is indicated via \l QNearFieldTarget::error().

\section2 Registering NDEF Message Handlers

The above described method (of reading NDEF messages) directly connects to the platform's NFC infrastructure.
However on some platforms (in particular mobile platforms) this may not actually trigger the target slot
if the application is currently running in the background. This is not desirable in cases where an
application wants to be activated if the platform detects a tag of particular type.
For this purpose the Qt NFC API provides the possibility to register an NDEF message handler. The handler
is called by the operating system, when the detected NDEF message matches the given filter criteria.
Depending on the platform it may even be possible to start the application that registered the handler.

\note This feature is not available on all platforms and, in addition to the code snippets below,
may require further platform specific setup.

\snippet annotatedurl/annotatedurl.cpp QNearFieldManager register handler

For comparison an application that uses an empty NDEF filter (match all behavior) in combination with
\l QNearFieldManager::registerNdefMessageHandler() would behave similarly to another application that uses
\l QNearFieldTarget::readNdefMessages() while being in the forground. For more information about
registration details of NDEF message handlers, see the
\l {QNearFieldManager#automatically-launching-ndef-message-handlers}{QNearFieldManager} class description.

The content of \c handleMessage() may look like the snippet below. Any incoming NDEF message of type
\c text or \c uri will be processed:

\snippet annotatedurl/annotatedurl.cpp handleMessage 1
\snippet annotatedurl/annotatedurl.cpp handleMessage 2
\snippet annotatedurl/annotatedurl.cpp handleMessage 3
\snippet annotatedurl/annotatedurl.cpp handleMessage 4

\section2 Sharing Files and Messages

Since Qt 5.3, Qt NFC provides a generic NFC share feature. If both devices support the same protocol,
the feature can be used to share files or NDEF messages. The advantage is that the two involved partners
can quickly establish a connection via NFC but transfer the data through, for example, Bluetooth or Wifi.
Effectively, this combines the low configuration effort of NFC with high data rate communication bearers
which usually require a much more complex setup.

\note The API does not make any guarantees about the actual communication bearer used during the transfer.
The bearer is chosen based on the device's capabilities and the properties of the to-be-shared data.

\l QNearFieldShareManager and \l QNearFieldShareTarget are responsible for accessing the NFC share feature.

\section1 QML Overview

The QML API only supports a very small subset of the Qt NFC feature set. This section outlines the available QML features.

\section2 Reading NDEF Messages

The user can specify NDEF filters and use those filters to register for the automatic reception of NDEF
messages which match those filters. The \l NearField::messageRecords property contains the list of NDEF records
of the last NDEF message read matching the given filters.

\snippet doc_src_qtnfc.qml QML register for messages

If no filter is set, the message handler will match all incoming NDEF messages.

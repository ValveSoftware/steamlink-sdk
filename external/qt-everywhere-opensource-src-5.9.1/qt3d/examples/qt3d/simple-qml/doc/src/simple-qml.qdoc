    \title Qt 3D: Simple QML Example
    \ingroup qt3d-examples-qml
    \brief A QML application that demonstrates how to render a scene in Qt 3D.

    \image simple-qml.png

    \e {Simple} demonstrates how to render a scene in Qt 3D.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \section1 Setting Up the Scene

    We set up the entire scene in the \e main.qml file.

    To be able to use the types in the Q3D and Q3D Render modules, we must
    import the modules:

    \quotefromfile simple-qml/main.qml
    \skipto import Qt3D.Core
    \printuntil Render 2.0

    The first entities we create are a \l Camera, which represents the camera
    used for the final rendering, and a camera controller, which allows us to
    control this camera using the keyboard or the mouse:

    \skipto Camera {
    \printuntil }
    \printuntil }

    A \l RenderSettings entity specifies a ForwardRenderer as the active
    framegraph:

    \printuntil },

    The event source is set by the Qt3DQuickWindow:

    \skipto InputSettings
    \printuntil }

    \section1

    \section1 Specifying Settings and Axes

    In the \e CameraController.qml file, we use the LogicalDevice type to define
    a set of actions and axes to use within the application:

    \quotefromfile simple-qml/CameraController.qml
    \skipto LogicalDevice {
    \printuntil ]
    \dots
    \skipto axes
    \printuntil ]
    \dots
    \skipto /^\}/
*/

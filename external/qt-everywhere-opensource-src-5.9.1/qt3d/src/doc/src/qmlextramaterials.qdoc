    \qmltype DiffuseMapMaterial

    \brief The DiffuseMapMaterial provides a default implementation of the phong lighting effect
    where the diffuse light component is read from a texture map.
    \since 5.7
    \inherits Qt3D.Render::Material

    The specular lighting effect is based on the combination of 3 lighting components ambient,
    diffuse and specular. The relative strengths of these components are controlled by means of
    their reflectivity coefficients which are modelled as RGB triplets:

    \list
    \li Ambient is the color that is emitted by an object without any other light source.
    \li Diffuse is the color that is emitted for rought surface reflections with the lights.
    \li Specular is the color emitted for shiny surface reflections with the lights.
    \li The shininess of a surface is controlled by a float property.
    \endlist

    This material uses an effect with a single render pass approach and performs per fragment
    lighting. Techniques are provided for OpenGL 2, OpenGL 3 or above as well as OpenGL ES 2.

    \qmltype GoochMaterial
    \inqmlmodule Qt3D.Extras
    \brief The GoochMaterial provides a material that implements the Gooch
    shading model, popular in CAD and CAM applications.
    \since 5.7
    \inherits Qt3D.Render::Material

    The Gooch lighting model uses both color and brightness to help show the
    curvature of 3D surfaces. This is often better than models such as Phong
    that rely purely upon changes in brightness. In situations such as in CAD
    and CAM applications where photorealism is not a goal, the Gooch shading
    model in conjunction with some kind of silhouette edge inking is a popular
    solution.

    The Gooch lighting model is explained fully in the \l{original Gooch
    paper}. The Gooch model mixes a diffuse object color with a user-provided
    cool color and warm color to produce the end points of a color ramp that is
    used to shade the object based upon the cosine of the angle between the
    vector from the fragment to the light source and the fragment's normal
    vector. Optionally, a specular highlight can be added on top. The relative
    contributions to the cool and warm colors by the diffuse color are
    controlled by the alpha and beta properties respecitvely.

    This material uses an effect with a single render pass approach and
    performs per fragment lighting. Techniques are provided for OpenGL 2,
    OpenGL 3 or above as well as OpenGL ES 2.

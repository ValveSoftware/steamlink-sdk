    \section1 Creating Line Charts

    To create a line chart, a QLineSeries instance is needed. Let's create one.

    \snippet linechart/main.cpp 1

    Then we add data to the series. We can use the append() member function or use the stream operator.

    \snippet linechart/main.cpp 2

    To present the data on the chart we need a QChart instance. We add the series to it, create the default axes, and set the title of the chart.

    \snippet linechart/main.cpp 3

    Then we create a QChartView object with QChart as a parameter. This way we don't need to create a QGraphicsView scene ourselves. We also set the Antialiasing on to have the rendered lines look nicer.

    \snippet linechart/main.cpp 4

    The chart is ready to be shown.

    \snippet linechart/main.cpp 5

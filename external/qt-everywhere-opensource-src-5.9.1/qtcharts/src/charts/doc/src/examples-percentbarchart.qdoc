    \ingroup qtcharts_examples

    \brief The example shows how to create a simple percent bar chart.

    A percent bar chart shows the data in sets as a percentage of
    all sets per category.

    Creating percent bar charts is just like creating a regular \l {BarChart Example} {bar chart}, except that for a
    percent bar charts, we use the QPercentBarSeries api instead of QBarSeries. Also, in the
    \l {BarChart Example} {bar chart} we used the nice numbers algorithm to make the y-axis numbering look better. With
    the percent bar chart there is no need for that, because the maximum y-axis value is always 100.

    \section1 Creating Percent Bar Charts

    The barsets are used in same way in all barcharts.
    To illustrate the difference between various barcharts, we use the same data in all examples.
    The data visualized by the bar chart is defined by QBarSet instances. Here we create the sets and append data
    to them. The data is appended here with the << operator. Alternatively the append method could be used.

    \snippet percentbarchart/main.cpp 1

    We create the series and append the barsets to it. The series takes ownership of the barsets. The series groups the data from sets to categories.
    The first values of each set are grouped together in the first category, the second values in the second category etc.

    \snippet percentbarchart/main.cpp 2

    Here we create the chart object and add the series to it. We set the title of the chart with setTitle, and then turn on animations of the series by calling
    setAnimationOptions(QChart::SeriesAnimations)

    \snippet percentbarchart/main.cpp 3

    To have categories displayed on axis, we need to create a QBarCategoryAxis for that. Here we create a category axis with a list of categories and
    set it to be the x-axis of the chart. The chart takes ownership of the axis. For the y-axis we use the default axis, which is created and scaled
    to series data by calling createDefaultAxes of the chart. Note that createDefaultAxes must be called before we set the category axis.
    Otherwise the default axis will override the category axis.

    \snippet percentbarchart/main.cpp 4

    We also want to show the legend. To do so, we get the legend pointer from the chart and set it to visible. We also place the legend to bottom of
    the chart by setting its alignment to Qt::AlignBottom.

    Finally we add the chart onto a view. We also turn on the antialiasing for the chartView.

    \snippet percentbarchart/main.cpp 6

    The chart is ready to be shown. We set the chart to be central widget of the window.
    We also set the size for the chart window and show it.

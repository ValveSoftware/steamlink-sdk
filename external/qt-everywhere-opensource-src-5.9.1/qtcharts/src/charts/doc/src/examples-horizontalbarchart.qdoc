    \title HorizontalBarChart Example
    \ingroup qtcharts_examples

    \brief The example shows how to create a horizontal bar chart.

    QHorizontalBarChart shows the data in sets as separate bars, which are grouped in categories. QHorizontalBarChart works just like
    QBarChart, except that the bars are drawn horizontally on the chart.

    \section1 Creating Horizontal Bar Charts

    The bar sets are used in the same way in all bar charts.
    To illustrate the difference between various bar charts, we use the same data in all examples.
    Data that bar chart visualizes, is defined by QBarSet instances. Here we create the sets and append data
    to them. The data is appended here with << operator. Alternatively, the append method could also be used.

    \snippet horizontalbarchart/main.cpp 1

    We create the series and append the bar sets to it. The series takes ownership of the barsets. The series groups the data from sets to categories.
    The first values of each set are grouped together in the first category; the second values in the second category, and so on.

    Here we create the chart object and add the series to it. We set the title for chart with setTitle and then turn on animations of the series by calling
    setAnimationOptions(QChart::SeriesAnimations).

    To have the categories displayed on axis, we need to create a QBarCategoryAxis. Here we create a category axis with a list of categories and
    set it to be the y-axis of the chart. The chart takes ownership of axis. For the x-axis we use the default axis, which is created and scaled to series data
    by calling createDefaultAxes of the chart. Note that the call for createDefaultAxes must be done before we set the category axis. Otherwise the default axis will
    override the category axis.

    We also want to show the legend. To do so, we get the legend pointer from chart and set it to visible. We also place the legend to the bottom of the chart by setting its alignment
    to Qt::AlignBottom.

    Finally we add the chart onto a view. We also turn on the antialiasing for the chartView.

    \snippet horizontalbarchart/main.cpp 6

    The chart is ready to be shown. We set the chart to be the central widget of the window.
    We also set the size for the chart window and show it.

    \title Default Prototypes Example

    This Qt Script example shows how to use default prototypes
    to make a non-QObject-based type scriptable.

    \image defaultprototypes-example.png

    With QScriptEngine::setDefaultPrototype() you can specify
    a Qt Script object that defines a scripting interface for
    a C++ type; Qt Script operations on values of such types
    will then be delegated to your prototype object. In this
    example, a simple scripting interface for QListWidgetItem is
    defined, so that the text of items can easily be accessed from
    script code.

    To define a scripting API for QListWidgetItem in terms of
    Qt properties and slots, we subclass QObject and QScriptable.

    \snippet script/defaultprototypes/prototypes.h 0

    A single property, \c{text}, is defined, along with a slot,
    \c{toString}.

    \snippet script/defaultprototypes/prototypes.cpp 0

    The implementation of the property accessors use
    the qscriptvalue_cast() function to cast the script object
    to a QListWidgetItem pointer. The normal C++ QListWidgetItem
    API is then used to implement the desired functionality.

    Although not shown here, it is possible to throw a script
    exception from a prototype function; for example, you could throw
    a TypeError exception if the qscriptvalue_cast() fails.

    QListWidgetItems are usually added to a QListWidget. While
    QListWidget is a QObject-based class, not all the functionality
    needed for this example are present. We can solve this by creating
    a default prototype for the QListWidget class as well. The
    prototype will augment the functionality already provided by the
    Qt Script QObject integration; i.e. if a property or slot is not
    found in the QListWidget object itself, the prototype will be used
    as a fallback.

    \snippet script/defaultprototypes/prototypes.h 1

    The additional slots will make it possible to add items to
    a QListWidget from script code, and to set the background
    color of the widget from a string.

    \snippet script/defaultprototypes/prototypes.cpp 1

    Again, we use qscriptvalue_cast() to cast the script object
    to the relevant C++ type, in this case a QListWidget pointer.
    The addItem() and addItems() functions simply forward their
    arguments to the corresponding functions in the QListWidget
    class. setBackgroundColor() gets the widget's palette, creates
    a QColor from the given string argument and changes the palette
    accordingly.

    \snippet script/defaultprototypes/main.cpp 0

    The relevant C++ types must be made known to Qt's meta type
    system.

    \snippet script/defaultprototypes/main.cpp 1

    For each type that we want to associate a prototype object with,
    we create an instance of the prototype class, pass it to
    QScriptEngine::newQObject(), and then create the link between
    the C++ type and the resulting script object by calling
    QScriptEngine::setDefaultPrototype().

    \snippet script/defaultprototypes/main.cpp 2

    In this example, a single QListWidget object is added as
    a global script variable, called \c{listWidget}. Script code
    can add items to this widget by calling addItem() or addItems().

    \snippet script/defaultprototypes/code.js 0

    Script code can connect to signals of the QListWidget object;
    signal handlers can use the interface defined in
    the QListWidgetItem prototype to manipulate item arguments.

    \snippet script/defaultprototypes/code.js 1

    Not shown in this example is how to make QListWidgetItem
    constructible from Qt Script code, i.e. to be able to
    write "new QListWidgetItem()" in a script. In order to do
    this, you have to define your own script constructor for
    the type. The constructor would just be a factory function
    that constructs a new C++ QListWidgetItem and returns it
    back to the script. See QScriptEngine::newFunction() for more
    information.

  \title Third-party Android Libraries
  \brief Provides instructions to include third-party Android libraries in an application.

  This guide describes how to include a Java-based third-party library in your application package.
  There are many Java libraries which provide APIs that may be useful to your application.
  One example is the \c{Google Play Services} add-on provided in the Android SDK. We will use this library
  as an example in this guide, but the same approach may be taken to include other libraries, provided
  that they have been made to be included as library projects in an Android application.

  \section1 Prerequisites

  This guide assumes that the \l{androiddeployqt} tool is used for constructing the deployment package.
  When using Qt Creator for building and deploying, androiddeployqt is used behind the scenes, so this also
  applies to development with Qt Creator. Explaining how to access the Java APIs after they have been
  included in the application is not in the scope of this guide.

  \section1 Including the Library in the Source

  The very first thing we need to do is to copy the actual library project into the source of our
  project. We want the contents of the library project to be copied without modifications into the
  packaging directory, so we need to place it into the \c{Android Package Source Directory}. This
  can be any directory which is pointed to by the \l{qmake} variable \c{ANDROID_PACKAGE_SOURCE_DIR}.

  If you are using Qt Creator, you can quickly set up the directory structure by clicking on the
  \gui{Create AndroidManifest.xml} button in the \gui{Deployment} settings of your project. This
  will create an \c{Android Package Source Directory} and place the \c{AndroidManifest.xml} file
  inside it. Copy the library project directory into this directory.

  For example, once it has been installed via the \c{Android SDK Maintenance} application,
  the \c{Google Play Services} library project is located under the path
  \c{$ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/google-play-services_lib}. If
  the \c{Android Package Source Directory} of our project is \c{$PROJECT_ROOT/android}, then we
  can copy the \c{google-play-services_lib} directory in there, creating
  \c{$PROJECT_ROOT/android/google-play-services_lib}.

  \section1 Adding the Library to the Project Dependencies

  Once the library code has been copied into the project, we need to tell the Android build system
  about it. This is done in the \c{project.properties} file. Create a file called \c{project.properties}
  inside the \c{Android Package Source Directory} and add a line to it which assigns the relative
  path of the library project to the property \c{android.library.reference.1}. If you want to include
  multiple library projects, increment the counter at the end of the property name for each.

  In our example, we would create \c{$PROJECT_ROOT/android/project.properties} and add the
  following contents:

  \badcode
  android.library.reference.1=google-play-services_lib/
  \endcode

  \section1 Deployment

  And that's it: Provided that the path referenced in the \c{project.properties} file is located
  under the \c{Android Package Source Directory}, the deployment tool will copy it into the
  packaging directory and perform the necessary steps to include it in your \c{APK}. You can
  now add Java code to your application which accesses the APIs provided by the library project.

\page androidgs.html
\title Getting Started with Qt for Android
\brief Provides instructions to install and configure your development environment.

\section1 Installing the Prerequisites

In order to use \l{Qt for Android}, you need the following:

\list
\li \l{http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html}{The Android SDK Tools}
    \note If your Qt version is earlier than v5.9, use the SDK tools package
    v25.2.5 or earlier.
\li \l{http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html}{The Android NDK}
    (recommended version 10e)
\li \l{http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html}{Java SE Development Kit} (JDK) v6 or later. You can also use \l{http://openjdk.java.net}{OpenJDK} on Linux.
\li \l{http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi}{Apache Ant} v1.8 or later
\endlist

After installing these tools, update the Android SDK by installing the API
and build tools packages required for development. You can install these packages
either through Android Studio or using the command line tools package you installed
earlier. For more details, refer to the
\l{https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/update.html}{Android Studio}
documentation.

\section2 Updating the Android SDK

The command line tools provided by the Android SDK Tools package also enables updating
the SDK, but without a GUI. For example, the following command on Ubuntu updates the SDK
by installing the latest \c build-tools, \c platform-tools, \c emulator, and \c patcher
packages:

\badcode
./android update sdk
\endcode

To install a specific package, use \c sdkmanager from
\c{<ANDROID_SDK_ROOT>/tools/bin}. For example, the following command installs the
\c android-10 platforms package on Ubuntu:

\badcode
./sdkmanager "platforms;android-10"
\endcode

For more details, refer to the
\l{https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/sdkmanager.html}{sdkmanager}
documentation.

\section1 Configuring Your Development Host

\section2 Windows

The default USB driver on Windows does not allow debugging using
Android Debug Bridge (ADB) tool. You must install the additional USB driver
provided by the \e extras Android SDK package. Use the following command from
the Windows command prompt to install the extras package:

\badcode
sdkmanager.bat "extras;google;usb_driver"
\endcode

After the package installation is complete, install the driver from
\c{<ANDROID_SDK_ROOT>/extras/google/usb_driver}. Try running a few basic
\l{http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html}{adb} commands now
and check whether your Android device responds to it.

\section2 64-bit Linux

If you're developing on a 64-bit Linux machine, you must install the
following dependencies in order to run 32-bit executables like \c adb, which
allows Qt Creator to find devices to deploy to:

\badcode
sudo apt-get install libstdc++6:i386 libgcc1:i386 zlib1g:i386 libncurses5:i386
\endcode

To run the emulator, the following dependencies are also necessary:

\code
sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2debian:i386
\endcode

\section2 Qt Creator IDE

The Qt Creator IDE that came with the Qt 5 installation on your development
host, must be configured to enable developing applications for Android. Launch
Qt Creator and select \uicontrol Tools > \uicontrol Options >
\uicontrol Devices > \uicontrol Android to add the Android NDK and SDK paths.
For more details, refer to \l{Qt Creator: Connecting Android Devices}{Qt Creator Manual}.

\section1 Testing Your Setup

Now you can test your development setup by running the examples that came
with the Qt 5 installation. You can browse these examples in
Qt Creator \uicontrol Welcome mode. Use the \c android filter in the search
field to list all the examples tested on Android.

To develop a simple application from scratch, see \l{Creating a Mobile Application}.

\page portingtoandroid.html
\title Porting to Android
\brief Provides instructions to port your existing Qt application to Android.

In this section, we are going to port an existing Qt Application to
\l{Qt for Android}{Android} and deploy it to the device.

Most Qt applications should be portable to Android with ease, unless they
depend on a specific hardware or software feature not supported by Android.
If your application is not using any such feature, deployment is probably the
only step that demands some changes to your application.

\include porting-notes.qdocinc using resources

The other approach is to deploy the resources into the package's \c{assets}
directory. It is the best option if you want to achieve better
interoperability with the Android APIs. You can access all resources in the
directory using the "assets:" prefix. Unlike qrc, this approach is not a
cross-platform solution.

The following step-by-step instructions guide you to port an existing Qt Quick
application to Android using the qrc approach:

\list 1
 \li Open the existing project in Qt Creator and configure it
     with "Android for ARM" kit. For more information, see
     \l{Qt Creator: Configuring Projects}
 \li Identify all the resources used by your application and add them to one
     or more qrc files.
     Qt Creator updates your qmake project file with the "RESOURCES"
     variable listing the qrc files you added.
 \li To load or refer to the resources in the qrc file from your C++ code,
     use the "qrc:" scheme followed by the absolute URL. For example, to
     load the \c{main.qml} file from \c{resources.qrc}, you can use the
     following C++ code:

     \code
     QQuickView viewer;
     viewer.setSource(QUrl("qrc:/qml/main.qml"));
     viewer.show();
     \endcode

     \note QML documents can refer to the contents in qrc files using the
     relative path to the document. Such references do not require the
     "\c{qrc:}" or "\c{:/}" prefix.
 \li Save the changes to your project and run the application.
\endlist

\note Qt Quick Controls in the application will use native
\l{Android Style}{Android style} if the target device is running
Android 3.0 (API 11) or later. The application should function normally on
devices with Android versions earlier than v3.0, but without native style for
controls.

Qt Creator deploys your application on the Android device, if the
device is detected by the PC. Otherwise, it tries to run the application on an
AVD (Android Virtual Device). You will be prompted to create one if there are no
AVDs found.

/*!
\page opensslsupport.html
\title Adding OpenSSL Support for Android
\brief Provides instructions to package OpenSSL libraries with your Qt application for Android.

The Qt installation package comes with OpenSSL support but the OpenSSL libraries
are not part of the package due to legal restrictions in some countries. If your
application depends on OpenSSL, consider packaging the SSL libraries with your
Application Package (APK) as the target device may or may not have them. You
can use the \l{QSslSocket::supportsSsl()} static function to check for SSL
support on the target.

The following instructions guide you to build and add the OpenSSL libraries to
the APK:
\list 1
 \li Download the \l{OpenSSL: Build Setup Script}{setup script} to configure
     the build environment.

     \note Ensure that you save the script with Unix line-endings if your
     build host is Unix or Linux.

 \li Make the following changes in the setup script:
     \list
      \li Set appropriate values to the \c _ANDROID_EABI and
          \c _ANDROID_ARCH variables. For example, to build for 64-bit ARM
          architecture using toolchain version v4.9, set
          \c aarch64-linux-android-4.9 and \c arch-arm64 values to
          \c _ANDROID_EABI and \c _ANDROID_ARCH respectively.
      \li Add the \c windows-x86 or \c windows-x86_64 to the \c hosts list on
          line \c 107, if your build host is Windows.
      \li Add the following after line \c 128 to build for 64-bit ARM
          architecture:

          \badcode
            arch-arm64)
          ANDROID_TOOLS="aarch64-linux-android-gcc aarch64-linux-android-ranlib aarch64-linux-android-ld"
              ;;
          \endcode
      \li Add the following after line \c 213 if \c _ANDROID_ARCH is set
          to \c arch-arm64:

          \badcode
          if [ "$_ANDROID_ARCH" == "arch-arm64" ]; then
                  export MACHINE=armv8
                  export RELEASE=2.6.37
                  export SYSTEM=android64
                  export ARCH=arm
                  export CROSS_COMPILE="aarch64-linux-android-"
          fi
          \endcode
      \li Comment out the \c FIPS section if it is not used or define the
          \c FIPS_SIG environment variable with the FIPS signature
          location.
     \endlist

 \li Define \c ANDROID_NDK_ROOT environment variable with the NDK
     location.

 \li Provide executable rights for the setup script and run it:

     \badcode
     chmod a+x Setenv-android.sh
     . ./Setenv-android.sh
     \endcode

     The script prints the following configuration details to the prompt when it
     completes:

     \badcode
     ANDROID_NDK_ROOT: /home/user1/android-ndk-r10d
     ANDROID_ARCH: arch-arm64
     ANDROID_EABI: aarch64-linux-android-4.9
     ANDROID_API: android-21
     ANDROID_SYSROOT: /home/user1/android-ndk-r10d/platforms/android-21/arch-arm64
     ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN: /home/user1/android-ndk-r10d/toolchains/aarch64-linux-android-4.9/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin
     FIPS_SIG:
     CROSS_COMPILE: aarch64-linux-androideabi-
     ANDROID_DEV: /home/user1/android-ndk-r10d/platforms/android-21/arch-arm64/usr
     \endcode

 \li Download the latest OpenSSL sources from \l{http://www.openssl.org/source}.

 \li Extract the sources to a folder and navigate to that folder using
     the CLI.
     \note If your development platform is Windows, you need \c msys with
     \c perl v5.14 or later to build OpenSSL.

 \li Configure the OpenSSL sources to build for Android using
     the following command:

     \badcode
     ./Configure shared android
     \endcode

     \note You must consider enabling/disabling the SSL features based on the
     legal restrictions in the region where your application is available.
     See the \l{OpenSSL Configure Options}{SSL configure options} for details about
     the configurable features.

 \li Run \c{make CALC_VERSIONS="SHLIB_COMPAT=; SHLIB_SOVER=" build_libs} to
     build the \c libcrypto and \c libssl shared libraries that are not versioned.

     \note Android does not load versioned libraries.

 \li Open your Qt project using Qt Creator and update the "Build Android APK"
     settings to add \e libcrypto and \e libssl as additional libraries for
     your project.

 \li Run your application to see it running on the device.
\endlist

Qt Creator builds your application and creates an application package (APK)
with the OpenSSL libraries bundled in it. Once the APK is ready, it uses \c adb
to deploy the APK on the target you chose and launch the application.

/*!
\page publishtogoogleplay.html
\title Publishing to Google Play
\brief Provides instructions to prepare your application for publishing.

\l{Qt for Android} provides a complete solution to develop, build, and package
your applications for Android. Most of these tasks, especially packaging and
deployment are handled by Qt Creator providing rich developer experience.

Every time you run the application using Qt Creator, an Android Application
Package (APK) is created and deployed onto the target (device or emulator) you
choose. With some minor changes to how the \e .apk is created, you can publish
your application on Google Play and monetize. The following
step-by-step instructions guide you to create an \e{.apk} that can go live
on Google Play:
\list 1
 \li Open your application project using Qt Creator v3.0 or later and change
 its \uicontrol Build settings to build release version.

 \li Select \uicontrol {Create Templates} under \uicontrol Build settings to
 create the template files such as \e AndroidManifest.xml and other
 resources.

 \note You can edit the \e AndroidManifest.xml in \uicontrol General or
 \uicontrol {XML Source} mode.

 \li Check for the following in \e AndroidManifest.xml:
 \list
  \li \uicontrol{Minimum required SDK} is set to API 9 or later.

  \note Qt Quick Controls with native \l{Android Style}{Android style}
  require API 11 (Android v3.0) or later.

  \li Add \uicontrol{Application name} and \uicontrol{Application icon}.

  \li \uicontrol Permissions list has all the required permissions.

  \li \uicontrol Features list has the software or hardware features that your
      application depends on. For example, NFC.
 \endlist

 \note Qt adds the default permissions and features based on the module
 dependencies of your application. If you do not want these default permissions
 and features, remove the \c{<!-- %%INSERT_PERMISSIONS -->} and
 \c{<!-- %%INSERT_FEATURES -->} comments from \e AndroidManifest.xml. For
 information on the manifest XML format, see \l{Android: App Manifest}.

 \li Set up a \uicontrol keystore to sign the \e .apk. You can create a new
 keystore if you do not have one. For more details, see
 \l{Android APK}{QtCreator: Specifying Settings for Packages}.

 \li Select \uicontrol{Open package location after build} and run your
 application to build the \e .apk. Qt Creator builds the \e .apk and opens the
 folder containing the \e .apk.

 \li Log in to the \l{Google Play Developer Console} and upload the \e .apk
 file, few screen captures of the application, and a description.
\endlist

Now your application is available to other Android device users via
Google Play. You can also choose to publish the application to a smaller
group, so that you can test and improve the application before publishing it to
a larger audience.

See \l{Deploying an Application on Android} for more information about how the
packaging is done and how you can influence it.

/*!
\page androidservices.html
\title Android Services
\brief Provides information about Android Services support in Qt.

Starting with Qt 5.7, you can create Android services using Qt. A service
is a component that runs in background, so, it has no user interface. It is
useful to perform long-term operations such as logging GPS, waiting for social
media notifications, and so on. A service will continue to run even if the
application that started it exits.

To create a service, do the following steps:
\list 1
 \li Uncomment the service part of your \c AndroidManifest.xml.

 \li Make sure the \c service tag contains an \c android:process=":some_name"
     attribute. It is needed to force the \c service to run in a separate
     process than the \c activity.

 \li If you're using the same application (.so file) for activity and also
     for service, you need to use \c android.app.arguments \c meta-data to
     pass some arguments to your \c main function in order to know which one
     is which.

 \li To enable background running, uncomment \c android.app.background_running
     \c meta-data and set it to true (\c android:value="true" ).

\endlist

Qt loads the \c .so file defined in \c android.app.lib_name \c meta-data,
and calls the \c main function with all the arguments set in
\c android.app.arguments \c meta-data.

See \l{http://developer.android.com/guide/components/services.html}{Android Services}
documentation for more information.

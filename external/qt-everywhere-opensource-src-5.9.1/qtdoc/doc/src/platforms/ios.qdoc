    Qt's iOS port allows you to run Qt applications on iOS devices,
    such as iPhones, iPads, and iPod Touches.

    \include apple-getting-started.qdocinc getting started

    \section1 Examples for iOS

    In Qt Creator, tested examples on iOS can be looked up. Use the \c ios
    keyword to search for examples in the Qt Creator Welcome mode. Note that
    some examples may have limited functionality.

    For a list of examples known to work on iOS devices, visit
    \l{Qt for iOS Examples}.

    \title Qt for iOS - Building from Source
    \brief Provides instructions to build Qt from source for iOS platform.

    Building \l {Qt for iOS} from sources requires \l Xcode with
    command-line tools installed. This can be done within Xcode from
    \gui Preferences > \gui Downloads > \gui Components >
    \gui {Command Line Tools}.

    Qt 5 sources can be obtained either by cloning the repositories or
    downloading the source package(s).

    We can then configure and build Qt. This is done from the Qt 5 top
    directory:

    \badcode
        > ./configure -xplatform macx-ios-clang -release
    \endcode

    For other configure options, see \l{Qt Configure Options}.

    Then, simply run \c{make}.

    \note A default build will include both simulator and device
    libraries. If you want to build for a single target, use the \c
    -sdk argument with either \c iphoneos or \c iphonesimulator.

    \page porting-to-ios.html
    \title Porting to iOS
    \brief Provides instructions to port your existing Qt application to iOS.

    In this section, we are going to port an existing Qt application to
    \l{Qt for iOS}{iOS} and deploy it to the device.

    Most Qt applications should be portable to iOS with ease, unless they
    depend on a specific hardware or software feature not supported on iOS.
    A major part of the porting effort consists of ensuring that all the
    application's assets (for example, QML files, images, and icons) are
    deployed correctly to the device.

    \include porting-notes.qdocinc using resources

    The following step-by-step instructions guide you to port an existing Qt Quick
    application to iOS using the qrc approach:

    \list 1
     \li Open the existing project in Qt Creator and configure it with
         \e {iOS} or \e {iOS Simulator} kit. For more information, see
         \l{Qt Creator: Configuring Projects}.

     \li Update all local directory imports in the \c{qml} files to use a local
         namespace. For example, to import the QML documents in the "contents"
         directory relative to \c{main.qml}, use the following import statement:

         \code
         import "contents" as Contents
         \endcode

     \li Identify all the resources used by your application and add them to one
         or more qrc files.
         Qt Creator updates your qmake project file with the \c RESOURCES
         variable, listing the qrc files you added.

     \li To load or refer to the resources in the qrc file from a C++ file,
         use the "\c{qrc:}" prefix for the URL. For example:

         \code
         QQuickView viewer;
         viewer.setSource(QUrl("qrc:qml/main.qml"));
         viewer.show();
         \endcode

         \note QML documents can refer to files in the resources simply by
         using the relative path to the document. Such references do not
        require the "\c{qrc:}" or "\c{:/}" prefix.

     \li Update the "Run" settings for your project as described in the
         \l{Qt Creator: Specifying Run Settings}

     \li If your application uses imports or plugins which depend on special Qt
         modules, these Qt modules should be added to the .pro file. For example, if
         your application uses the \l{Qt Multimedia} import in QML, you should add
         the following to your .pro file:

         \badcode
         QT += multimedia
         \endcode

         In Qt for iOS, everything is compiled statically and placed into the application
         bundle. The applications are "sandboxed" inside their bundles and cannot make use
         of shared object files. Because of this, also the plugins used by the Qt modules
         need to be statically linked. To do this, define the required plugins using the
         \l QTPLUGIN variable. For example, to use the camera APIs from Qt Multimedia:

         \badcode
         QTPLUGIN += qavfcamera
         \endcode

         See \l {http://wiki.qt.io/QtMultimedia_iOS}{Qt Multimedia on iOS}
         for information on other Qt Multimedia plugins. If your project uses APIs
         from \l {Qt Sensors}, use the following:

         \badcode
         QT += sensors
         QTPLUGIN += qtsensors_ios
         \endcode

     \li Save the changes to your project and run the application.
    \endlist

    Qt Creator deploys your application on the iOS device, if the
    device is detected and configured correctly in Xcode. It is also possible to
    test the application in iOS Simulator. For more information, see
    \l {http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-developing-ios.html}{Connecting iOS Devices}.

    \sa {Platform Notes - iOS}
*/

/*!
    \page platform-notes-ios.html
    \title Platform Notes - iOS
    \brief This page contains information about building Qt applications for and running them on the iOS platform.

    \section1 Deployment

    Developing, building, running, and debugging a Qt for iOS application can all be done
    with Qt Creator on \macos. The toolchain is provided by Apple's Xcode,
    and running qmake on a project targeted for iOS will also generate an
    Xcode project file (.xcodeproj), with initial application settings. As Qt
    Creator does not provide an interface for managing all of the settings specific
    to iOS platform, it is sometimes necessary to adjust them in Xcode directly.
    Checking that the application is configured correctly is especially important
    before submitting an application for publishing in Apple's App Store.

    \target Info.plist
    \section2 Information Property List Files

    Information property list file (Info.plist) on iOS and \macos is used for configuring
    an application bundle. These configuration settings include:

    \list
        \li Application display name and identifier
        \li Required device capabilities
        \li Supported user interface orientations
        \li Icons and launch images
    \endlist

    See the documentation on \l {https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Introduction/Introduction.html}
    {Information Property List File} in iOS Developer Library for details.

    When qmake is run, an \c Info.plist file is generated with appropriate default values.

    It is advisable to replace the generated Info.plist with your own copy, to prevent
    it from being overwritten the next time qmake is run. You can define a custom information
    property list with \l QMAKE_INFO_PLIST variable in your .pro file.

    \badcode
    ios {
        QMAKE_INFO_PLIST = ios/Info.plist
    }
    \endcode

    \section2 Application Assets

    For files that cannot be bundled into Qt resources, \l QMAKE_BUNDLE_DATA qmake variable
    provides a way to specify a set of files to be copied into the application bundle. For
    example:

    \badcode
    ios {
        fontFiles.files = $$files(fonts/*.ttf)
        fontFiles.path = fonts
        QMAKE_BUNDLE_DATA += fontFiles
    }
    \endcode

    For image resources, an alternative way is to make use of \l {Create asset catalogs and sets}
    {asset catalogs} in Xcode, which can be added in a similar way:
    \badcode
    ios {
        assets_catalogs.files = $$files($$PWD/*.xcassets)
        QMAKE_BUNDLE_DATA += assets_catalogs
    }
    \endcode
    Important: resources are compiled only if the .path variable is not set.
    It is possible to recursively copy and compile directories though.

    \section2 Icons

    Icons need to be set in the Info.plist and copied to the application bundle.
    Xcode has special support for icons, but when using Qt, it is usually better
    to set them in the .pro file.

    To support all resolutions and devices, several images should be created.
    A detailed list of what is required is available at \l {App Icons on iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch}{Icon files}.
    The filename is not important, but the actual pixel size is.
    Just a few icons are required.
    However, to support both iPhone and iPad, the following images
    are required:

    \list
        \li AppIcon29x29.png: 29 x 29
        \li AppIcon29x29@2x.png: 58 x 58
        \li AppIcon29x29@2x~ipad.png: 58 x 58
        \li AppIcon29x29~ipad.png: 29 x 29
        \li AppIcon40x40@2x.png: 80 x 80
        \li AppIcon40x40@2x~ipad.png: 80 x 80
        \li AppIcon40x40~ipad.png: 40 x 40
        \li AppIcon50x50@2x~ipad.png: 100 x 100
        \li AppIcon50x50~ipad.png: 50 x 50
        \li AppIcon57x57.png: 57 x 57
        \li AppIcon57x57@2x.png: 114 x 114
        \li AppIcon60x60@2x.png: 120 x 120
        \li AppIcon72x72@2x~ipad.png: 144 x 144
        \li AppIcon72x72~ipad.png: 72 x 72
        \li AppIcon76x76@2x~ipad.png: 152 x 152
        \li AppIcon76x76~ipad.png: 76 x 76
    \endlist

    These files should be copied to the application bundle by adding something
    like the following code snippet to the .pro file:

    \badcode
    ios {
        ios_icon.files = $$files($$PWD/ios/AppIcon*.png)
        QMAKE_BUNDLE_DATA += ios_icon
    }
    \endcode

    For the icons to be used, the filenames also have to be listed in the Info.plist. The best way is to list all icon files
    using the \c CFBundleIconFiles key.
    The iPad specific version can be given using the \c CFBundleIcons~ipad key, by adding something
    like the following code snippet to Info.plist:

    \badcode
    <key>CFBundleIcons</key>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundlePrimaryIcon</key>
        <dict>
            <key>CFBundleIconFiles</key>
            <array>
                <string>AppIcon29x29.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon29x29@2x.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon40x40@2x.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon57x57.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon57x57@2x.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon60x60@2x.png</string>
            </array>
        </dict>
    </dict>
    <key>CFBundleIcons~ipad</key>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundlePrimaryIcon</key>
        <dict>
            <key>CFBundleIconFiles</key>
            <array>
                <string>AppIcon29x29.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon29x29@2x.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon40x40@2x.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon57x57.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon57x57@2x.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon60x60@2x.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon29x29~ipad.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon29x29@2x~ipad.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon40x40~ipad.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon40x40@2x~ipad.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon50x50~ipad.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon50x50@2x~ipad.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon72x72~ipad.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon72x72@2x~ipad.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon76x76~ipad.png</string>
                <string>AppIcon76x76@2x~ipad.png</string>
            </array>
        </dict>
    </dict>
    \endcode

    This ensures that the appropriate files are copied to the right place and the correct icons are
    used as required by the Apple App Store.
    Ad-hoc distributions should also include the following filenames in the application bundle
    to visualize the application in iTunes:
    \list
        \li iTunesArtwork 512x512
        \li iTunesArtwork@2x 1024x1024
    \endlist

    \section2 Launch Images

    Like icons, launch images consist of images that need to be copied to the application bundle
    and keys that have to be set in the Info.plist.

    To support the iPhone 6, a launch file (an interface builder .xib file or a storyboard file) should be provided.
    For more information, see \l{https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentati on/userexperience/conceptual/MobileHIG/LaunchImages.html}{Launch Images}.
    Assuming that you called the launch file Launch.xib, it can be added to the Info.plist as follows:
    \badcode
    <key>UILaunchStoryboardName</key>
    <string>Launch</string>
    \endcode
    It is possible to use launch images (PNG files), as described below, to support the iPhone 6, but it is not recommended.
    Qmake generates a default LaunchScreen.xib, so it is better to use another name for a custom launch screen to avoid clashes.

    Starting with iOS 7, the launch images are defined using the \c UILaunchImages key.
    To support these devices, you need to prepare the following images:
    \list
        \li LaunchImage-iOS7-568h@2x.png: 640 x 1136
        \li LaunchImage-iOS7-Landscape.png: 1024 x 768
        \li LaunchImage-iOS7-Landscape@2x.png: 2048 x 1536
        \li LaunchImage-iOS7-Portrait.png: 768 x 1024
        \li LaunchImage-iOS7-Portrait@2x.png: 1536 x 2048
        \li LaunchImage-iOS7@2x.png: 640 x 960
    \endlist

    The images can be added to the Info.plist as follows:
    \badcode
    <key>UILaunchImages</key>
    <array>
        <dict>
            <key>UILaunchImageMinimumOSVersion</key>
            <string>7.0</string>
            <key>UILaunchImageName</key>
            <string>LaunchImage-iOS7</string>
            <key>UILaunchImageOrientation</key>
            <string>Portrait</string>
            <key>UILaunchImageSize</key>
            <string>{320, 568}</string>
        </dict>
        <dict>
            <key>UILaunchImageMinimumOSVersion</key>
            <string>7.0</string>
            <key>UILaunchImageName</key>
            <string>LaunchImage-iOS7</string>
            <key>UILaunchImageOrientation</key>
            <string>Portrait</string>
            <key>UILaunchImageSize</key>
            <string>{320, 480}</string>
        </dict>
    </array>
    <key>UILaunchImages~ipad</key>
    <array>
        <dict>
            <key>UILaunchImageMinimumOSVersion</key>
            <string>7.0</string>
            <key>UILaunchImageName</key>
            <string>LaunchImage-iOS7-Landscape</string>
            <key>UILaunchImageOrientation</key>
            <string>Landscape</string>
            <key>UILaunchImageSize</key>
            <string>{768, 1024}</string>
        </dict>
        <dict>
            <key>UILaunchImageMinimumOSVersion</key>
            <string>7.0</string>
            <key>UILaunchImageName</key>
            <string>LaunchImage-iOS7-Portrait</string>
            <key>UILaunchImageOrientation</key>
            <string>Portrait</string>
            <key>UILaunchImageSize</key>
            <string>{768, 1024}</string>
        </dict>
        <dict>
            <key>UILaunchImageMinimumOSVersion</key>
            <string>7.0</string>
            <key>UILaunchImageName</key>
            <string>LaunchImage-iOS7</string>
            <key>UILaunchImageOrientation</key>
            <string>Portrait</string>
            <key>UILaunchImageSize</key>
            <string>{320, 568}</string>
        </dict>
        <dict>
            <key>UILaunchImageMinimumOSVersion</key>
            <string>7.0</string>
            <key>UILaunchImageName</key>
            <string>LaunchImage-iOS7</string>
            <key>UILaunchImageOrientation</key>
            <string>Portrait</string>
            <key>UILaunchImageSize</key>
            <string>{320, 480}</string>
        </dict>
    </array>
    \endcode

    To support earlier iOS versions, one can use the \c UILaunchImageFile string in the Info.plist:
    \badcode
    <key>UILaunchImageFile</key>
    <string>LaunchImage</string>
    \endcode
    The name defaults to \c Default, but qmake generates some of the images, so it is easier to use another name (for example LaunchImage as we did) to avoid clashes.
    \list
        \li LaunchImage.png: 320 x 480
        \li LaunchImage@2x.png: 640 x 960
        \li LaunchImage-568h@2x.png: 640 x 1136
        \li LaunchImage-Landscape.png: 1024 x 748
        \li LaunchImage-Landscape@2x.png: 2048 x 1496
        \li LaunchImage-Portrait.png: 768 x 1004
        \li LaunchImage-Portrait@2x.png: 1536 x 2008
    \endlist

    You can change the filenames as long as the Info.plist and filenames stay in sync.

    Finally, all these files have to be copied to the application bundle by adding something
    like the following code snippet to the .pro file:
    \badcode
    ios {
        app_launch_images.files = $$PWD/ios/Launch.xib $$files($$PWD/ios/LaunchImage*.png)
        QMAKE_BUNDLE_DATA += app_launch_images
    }
    \endcode

    This allows you to produce universal applications with valid LaunchImages as required by the Apple App Store.
    \important \c "launch_images" is used internally by Qt, so it will be overwritten if used in your .pro file.

    \section1 Publishing to Apple App Store

    Verifying that your Qt for iOS application is ready for publishing to App Store can be done
    as described in \l {https://developer.apple.com/Library/ios/documentation/LanguagesUtilities/Conceptual/iTunesConnect_Guide/Chapters/SubmittingTheApp.html} {Submitting the Application}.
    To submit the application, you can use Xcode, or the Application Loader (installed with Xcode).
    Qt Creator does not provide an interface for managing all of the settings in an Xcode project configuration.

    The application should be tested on a variety of iOS versions and devices, depending on what
    it's targeted to support. The minimum deployment target for Qt applications is iOS 7.0.

    The actual publishing process involves creating a distribution certificate and a provision profile,
    creating a signed archive of your application, and running a set of validation tests on it.

    See the \l {https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/SubmittingYourApp/SubmittingYourApp.html}
    {App Distribution Guide} in iOS Developer Library for more information.

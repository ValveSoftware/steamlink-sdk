    \title What's New in Qt 5.3
    \brief Lists the new features in Qt 5.3

    The focus for Qt 5.3 is mainly about improving the stability, performance,
    and first-time user experience of the product. Qt 5.3 will also offer
    a good amount of new and exciting features, and a new platform:
    WinRT/Windows Phone.

    This page is a summary of new features. For specific API changes, the
    \l{List of API Changes} section contains links to new and obsolete classes.

    \section1 New Modules

    \list
    \li \l{Enginio Manual}{Enginio} - A client-side library for \l{Qt Cloud Services}.
    \li \l{Qt WebSockets} - An add-on module that implements the WebSocket standard
    \l{http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455}{RFC 6455}
    \endlist

    For more information, visit the \l{All Modules} page.

    \section1 New Platforms

    Qt 5.3 introduces support for WinRT and Windows Phone on a beta quality
    level. Most features in Qt Core, GUI, Network, Widgets, QML, Quick, and
    Sensors are already working.

    \list
    \li Windows Runtime platforms: Windows 8/RT (Modern UI), Windows Phone 8.
    The documentation is available at \l{Qt for WinRT}.
    \endlist


    \section1 New Features

    \section2 Qt Core Module
    \list
    \li Logging: It is now possible to configure logging rules (for example, the
    message types for which categories are printed) on the filesystem or in
    \e{QtProject/qtlogging.ini}. You can also use qCDebug and friends in a
    printf-style way, in addition to the streaming operator syntax.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt GUI Module
    \list
    \li Qt's iOS plugin now implements support for input methods, spell checking
    and word completion.
    \li Embedded Linux platform specifics (plugins like eglfs and linuxfb) are
    now documented.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Quick Module
    \list
    \li Introduced QQuickWidget for easy and flexibe integration of views
    with QWidget-based UIs.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Quick Controls Module
    \list
    \li The \l Calendar control was added. Calendar allows selection of dates from
    a grid of days, similar to QCalendarWidget.
    \li \l MenuStyle and \l MenuBarStyle controls introduced.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Quick Dialogs Module
    \list

    \li The QML implementations are now built with QtQuick.Controls (and
    therefore the source is moved from qtdeclarative.git to
    qtquickcontrols.git), which enables adding some features such as folder
    shortcuts (both standard locations and bookmarked locations), and comboboxes
    for file filters and writing systems.
    \li There is a new Dialog type which provides only the standard buttons, so
    that you can construct dialogs with arbitrary contents, such as various
    types of input dialogs and pickers.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Network Module
    \list
    \li Support for the SPDY protocol (version 3.0) was added.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Multimedia Module
    \list
    \li A new QCameraInfo class was added. It allows to get static information
    about cameras such as physical position and sensor orientation. In addition,
    the class provides a way to list available cameras on the system and
    deprecates QCamera::availableDevices().
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt WebKit Module
    \list
    \li Support for HTML5 Video Track. Subtitles and captions for HTML5 video.
    \li Support for Indexed DB API. See \l{http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/}.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Positioning Module
    \list
    \li The module has been ported to Android and iOS. Android supports position
    and satellite updates while iOS supports position updates only.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Bluetooth Module
    \list
    \li The module has been ported to Android.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt QML Module
    \list
    \li Profiling support for V4, using the same event types as the QML profiler.
    \li Profile or debug multiple QML engines in one application with the new EngineControl debug service.
    \endlist

    \section2 XInput2 Smooth Scrolling
    \list
    \li Qt's XCB plugin now listens to XInput2 scrolling events which means
    it will respond to high resolution smooth scrolling events on devices where
    they are supported. Currently this is mainly touch pads.
    \endlist

    \section1 Qt Creator 3.1

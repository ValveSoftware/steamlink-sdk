    \title What's New in Qt 5.9
    \brief Lists the new features in Qt 5.9.

    Qt 5.9 is a long-term support (LTS) release.

    \section1 New Features in Qt 5.9

    \section2 Qt Core Module
    \list
        \li Added the \c {qfloat16 f} and \c {qfloat16 &f} overload functions to
            the QDataStream class for writing a floating point number to the
            stream and reading it from the stream.
        \li Made the QProcessEnvironment class available on iOS, tvOS, watchOS,
            and VxWorks.
        \li QRegularExpression now requires the PCRE2 library version 10.20, or
            later. Support for the PCRE1 library was dropped. A copy of PCRE2
            is shipped with Qt and will automatically be used on the platforms
            that lack it.
        \li Added the QOperatingSystemVersion class to provide convenient
            access to the operating system and version.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt GUI Module
    \list
        \li Made the QPainter class' GL engine functional with core profile
            OpenGL contexts.
        \li Added the QImage::reinterpretAsFormat() function to change the image
            format without changing the data.
        \li Added support for \e {compute shaders} in QOpenGLShader::ShaderType
            and QOpenGLShaderProgram also with OpenGL ES 3.1 and newer.
        \li Enabled stem-darkening and gamma-correction on OpenType fonts on
            platforms that use FreeType, if supported.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Multimedia Module
    Added the following QML properties:
    \list
        \li \l{CameraCapture::supportedResolutions}
            {CameraCapture.supportedResolutions}
        \li \l{CameraFlash::supportedModes}{CameraFlash.supportedModes}
        \li \l{MediaPlayer::notifyInterval}{MediaPlayer.notifyInterval} (also
            for the \l Audio and \l Video types)
        \li \l{MediaPlayer::loops}{Video.loops}
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Network Module
    \list
        \li Added the QNetworkAccessManager::addStrictTransportSecurityHosts()
            function to support HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) policies.
        \li Added the QNetworkAccessManager::redirectPolicy() function and the
            QNetworkRequest::RedirectPolicy enumeration to determine whether the
            Network Access API should automatically follow a HTTP redirect
            response.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt QML Module
    \list
        \li Added support for ahead-of-time generation of QML type caches.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Quick Module
    \list
        \li Enabled caching OpenGL shader program binaries used by the Qt GUI
            module (QPainter's GL paint engine) and the Qt Quick scenegraph on
            disk to improve application-startup and view-initialization times.
        \li Added an OpenVG backend for Qt Quick.
        \li Enabled making window-screen associations directly from QML by using
            \l {Window::screen}{Window.screen} and \l{Qt::application}
            {Qt.application.screens}. This enables creating multi-screen aware
            applications for desktop and embedded without involving C++ code.
        \li Added a way to query information about the font actually used to
            render a \l [QtQuick] Text type.
        \li Added an image provider that can share decoded image data and memory
            between processes.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Quick Controls 2 Module
    \list
        \li Introduced new QML types: \l DelayButton, \l ScrollView.
        \li Added multi-touch support.
        \li Made the \l ComboBox type editable.
        \li Added the \l{Drawer::}{interactive} property for making a \l Drawer
            type non-interactive and persistent.
        \li Enabled live value updates (by default) for the \l Slider,
            \l [QtQuickControls2] RangeSlider, and \l Dial types.
        \li Added dedicated notification signals for user interaction:
            AbstractButton::toggled(), Slider::moved(),
            SpinBox::valueModified(), and so on.
        \li Enabled incremental discrete scrolling with the \l ScrollBar type.
        \li Added enabling and disabling the swipe for the \l SwipeDelegate
            type. In addition, the swipe can now be opened programmatically.
        \li Added support for the vertical orientation to the
            \l {SwipeView::orientation}{SwipeView.orientation} property.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt 3D Module
    \list
        \li Added rendering Qt Quick 2 scenes to a texture and interacting with
            them within a 3D world.
        \li Added a Technical Preview of a new animation subsystem that enables
            non-blocking, keyframe animations on the threadpool and exporting
            from animations from Blender.
        \li Added Physics Based Rendering (PBR) material
            (\l{Qt3DExtras::}{QMetalRoughMaterial} and
            \l{Qt3DExtras::}{QTexturedMetalRoughMaterial}) to Qt3DExtras for
            improved appearance when used with environment maps.
        \li Added 3D text support to Qt3DExtras.
        \li Added the LevelOfDetail type to control the representation of an
            entity based on distance from the observer or size on the screen. It
            comes with a convenience loader class that loads different QML
            files.
        \li Made the \l Mesh type plugin based. It comes with plugins for the
            Wavefront OBJ, PLY and FBX formats and makes it easy to add other
            formats.
        \li Added distance field based 2D textured text that can be freely
            rotated but is based on planar geometry.
    \endlist

    \section2 Qt Bluetooth Module
    \list
        \li Added Classic Bluetooth support for WinRT.
        \li Added Bluetooth LE Peripheral support for Android.
    \endlist

        \li Enabled styling the HTML copyright using CSS.
        \li Added support for handing the rendering of map items to the plugin.
        \li Added the \e MapboxGL plugin that is based on the
            \c mapbox-gl-native mapping engine.
        \li Added the \l Map::fitViewportToVisibleMapItems() method to only
            consider visible items when fitting the viewport.
        \li Added the MapItemGroup type to combine multiple map items in a
            separate QML file.
        \li Added the \l{Map::fieldOfView}{Map.fieldOfView} property to control
            the camera's field of view when the map is tilted.
        \li Added the MapParameter type to expose and control plugin-specific

\title Integrating Web Content
\brief Qt enables web content integration.

To create Qt-based web applications, Qt provides interfaces that support a wide
range of standard web techologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These
interfaces enable applications to embed content from the World Wide Web.

It is also possible to combine Qt C++ and QML code with HTML and JavaScript to
create web applications. Through \l{Qt WebChannel}, several of Qt's APIs are
accessible to remote clients.

\section1 WebEngine in Qt

Qt provides the Chromium-based Qt WebEngine module for applications
targeting desktop and embedded platforms. For example, a web browser
application for Linux platform.

It also provides the Qt WebView module, which uses the native web engine
of the platform. For example, a RSS feed reader Qt Quick application for
Android and iOS.

These pages contain information about porting applications to use Qt WebEngine
and the various APIs:
\list
\li \l{Qt WebEngine Overview}
\li \l{Qt WebView}
\li \l{Porting from Qt WebKit to Qt WebEngine}
\endlist

\section1 Qt and HTML-JavaScript Hybrid Applications

The \l{Qt WebChannel} module enables HTML or JavaScript clients to access
Qt APIs such as QObject. It provides both C++ or QML API, allowing Qt apps
to communicate with JavaScript and HTML frontends.

These pages contain more information about the various APIs:
\list
\li \l{Qt WebChannel JavaScript API}{JavaScript API}
\li \l{Qt WebChannel C++ Classes}{C++ API}
\li \l{Qt WebChannel QML Types}{QML API}
\li \l{Qt WebChannel Standalone Example}{Standalone Example}
\endlist

\title Use Case - Responding To User Input in QML
\brief Example of how to accept user input and respond to it in a QML application

\section1 Supported Types of User Input

The \l {Qt Quick} module provides support for the most common types of user input,
including mouse and touch events, text input and key-press events.  Other
modules provide support for other types of user input (for example, the
\l {Qt Sensors} module provides support for shake-gestures in QML applications).

This article covers how to handle basic user input; for further information
about motion-gesture support, please see the \l {Qt Sensors} documentation. For
information about audio-visual input, please see the \l {Qt Multimedia} documentation.

\section2 Mouse and Touch Events

The \l MouseArea type allows mouse and touch events to be handled in a QML
application.  A \l MouseArea can be combined with either an \l Image or a
\l Rectangle and \l Text object to implement a simple button.

For more advanced use cases requiring multiple touch points, please read the
documentation for the \l MultiPointTouchArea type and the \l PinchArea type.

Note that some types have their own built in input handling. For example,
\l Flickable responds to mouse dragging, mouse wheel scrolling, touch dragging,
and touch flicking by default.

\section2 Keyboard and Button Events

Button and key presses, from buttons on a device, a keypad, or a keyboard,
can all be handled using the \l Keys attached property. This attached property
is available on all \l Item derived types, and works with the \l Item::focus property
to determine which type receives the key event. For simple key handling, you can set the focus
to true on a single \l Item and do all your key handling there.

For text input the \l {Qt Quick} module provides several built-in types.
In particular, the \l TextInput and \l TextEdit types allow for single-line
entry and multi-line editing respectively.

Here is all you need to get a working TextInput:

\code
import QtQuick 2.3

TextInput {
    focus: true
    text: "Initial Text"
}
\endcode

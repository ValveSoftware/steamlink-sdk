    \title High DPI Displays
    \brief Concepts of High DPI Displays

    \section1 High DPI Displays

    High DPI Displays are displays with increased pixel density compared to standard
    DPI displays.

    This pixel density is measured in Dots per Inch (DPI) or Pixels Per Inch (PPI),
    and is determined by the number of display pixels and physical size. This means that
    the number of pixels alone is not enough to determine if a display falls into the
    high-DPI category.

    A 4K monitor has a fixed number of pixels (~8M), however the DPI varies between 185
    (23 inch) and 110 (40 inch). The former is around 2x standard 96 DPI desktop resolution,
    while the latter is barely over it.

    \section2 Issues with High DPI

    High DPI Displays cause a number of issues for existing applications:

    \list
        \li Applications using UI designs with fixed coordinates look small.
            The combination of font size specification in points and other sizes in
            pixels is particularly problematic since points are independent of the monitor
            resolution. For example, a frame of 40x20 pixels around the text "hello"
            using a 12pt font looks correct on low resolution monitors,
            but the frame will be too small on high DPI monitors, causing the text
            to be clipped.

        \li Applications must adapt to situations where users have multiple displays with
            varying resolution. For example, they might use a 4K monitor for the
            document window of an image editor and a low resolution monitor for the
            tool box.
    \endlist

    The traditional approach to supporting high DPI has been one where Qt scaled fonts
    automatically, and then provided a DPI value that application code could use
    to scale the rest of the UI.

    \section2 Qt High DPI Support Overview

    Qt supports a high DPI mode where the main coordinate system is virtualized and
    made independent of the display pixel density. This mode is implemented by some
    operating systems (\macos, iOS). In addition, Qt contains an implementation which
    may be used where operating system support is missing.

    Geometry is now specified in device independent pixels. This includes widget and
    item geometry, event geometry, desktop, window and screen geometry, and animation
    velocities. Rendered output is in device pixels, which corresponds to the display
    resolution. The ratio between the device independent and device pixel coordinate
    systems is the devicePixelRatio.

    Applications mostly work with device independent pixels. Notable exceptions are
    OpenGL and code that works with raster graphics.

    \section2 Operating System Support

    The operating systems supported by Qt offer the following support for high DPI displays:

    \section3 \macos and iOS

    The Apple platforms implement scaling and coordinate system virtualization in the
    in the operating system. Normally, no special configuration is required.

    \note On \macos, high-DPI support is enabled by settings in the Info.plist file.
    Make sure they are present.
    \code
        <key>NSPrincipalClass</key>
        <string>NSApplication</string>
        <key>NSHighResolutionCapable</key>
        <string>True</string>
    \endcode
    Never versions of qmake will generate Info.plist's with the NSPrincipalClass key,
    which is sufficient since NSHighResolutionCapable is true by default.

    \note \macos and iOS may apply further virtualization such that device pixels do not
    correspond 1:1 to display pixels. This happens on the iPhone 6+ and on \macos configured
    with 'display scaling' enabled.

    \section3 Microsoft Windows

    \section4 Scaling

    The user can choose a scaling factor from the control panel or via context menu.
    This works by making the functions for querying the system metrics return
    different values for standard font sizes, sizes of window borders, and so on.
    It does not perform any actual scaling.

    \section4 DPI Awareness

    An application on Windows can assume one of the following levels of "DPI Awareness":

    \table
        \header
            \li DPI Awareness Level
            \li Meaning

        \row
            \li DPI Unaware
            \li This level has been introduced in Windows-Vista. Windows will pretend to the
                application that it is running on a standard display of 96 DPI of 1920x1080
                and scale the application accordingly. It is intended to accommodate older
                applications designed for low DPI displays. Some artifacts may result from
                this type of scaling.

        \row
            \li System-DPI Aware
            \li This level has been introduced in Windows-Vista. It differs from
                \e{Per-Monitor DPI Aware} only when multiple monitors are connected.
                Windows will calculate a scaling suitable for all connected monitors.

        \row
            \li Per-Monitor DPI Aware
            \li This level has been introduced in Windows 8.1. Windows does not perform
                any scaling at all.

    \endtable

    Qt applications by default are \e{Per-Monitor DPI Aware} on Windows 8.1 or \e{System-DPI Aware}
    on older versions of Windows. As of Qt 5.4, the level can be specified by passing a parameter
    to the platform plugin (see \l{Using qt.conf}):

    \code
    <application> -platform windows:dpiawareness=0,1,2
    \endcode

    \section2 High DPI Support in Qt

    \list
        \li Ability to provide pixmaps or artwork for high resolution:
            see \l{Drawing High Resolution Versions of Pixmaps and Images}.

        \li Qt 5.6 supports cross-platform high-DPI scaling for legacy applications,
            similar to the scaling done natively by \macos. This allows applications written
            for low-DPI screens to run unchanged on high-DPI devices. This feature is
            opt-in, and can be enabled by the following environment variables:
            \list

                \li \c QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR [boolean] enables automatic scaling,
                based on the pixel density of the monitor. This will not change the size
                of point sized fonts, since point is a physical unit of measure. Multiple
                screens may get different scale factors.

                \li \c QT_SCALE_FACTOR [numeric] defines a global scale
                factor for the whole application, including point sized fonts.

                \li \c QT_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTORS [list] specifies scale factors
                for each screen. This will not change the size
                of point sized fonts. This environment variable is
                mainly useful for debugging, or to work around monitors with wrong
                \l {https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_Display_Identification_Data}
                {EDID information}(Extended Display Identification Data).

                The format can be either a semicolon-separated list of scale
                factors in the same order as QGuiApplication::screens(), or a
                semicolon-separated list of \c name=value pairs, where \c
                name is the same as QScreen::name().

                \endlist

            While the macOS style fully supports high-DPI, the Windows desktop style
            currently has some limitations with certain scale factors. In these cases,
            consider using the Fusion style instead, which aims to support high-DPI in
            all cases.

            \note Non-integer scale factors may cause significant
            scaling/painting artifacts.

         \li The application attribute \c Qt::AA_EnableHighDpiScaling, introduced in Qt 5.6,
             enables automatic scaling based on the pixel density of the monitor.

         \li The application attribute \c Qt::AA_DisableHighDpiScaling, introduced in Qt 5.6,
             turns off all scaling. This is intended for applications that need to use
             actual window system coordinates, regardless of environment variables. This
             attribute takes priority over Qt::AA_EnableHighDpiScaling.

        \li An experimental implementation of high-DPI scaling was introduced in Qt 5.4.
            It was enabled by the environment variable \c QT_DEVICE_PIXEL_RATIO, which
            could be set to a numerical scale factor or \c "auto". This variable is
            deprecated in Qt 5.6.
        \endlist

    \section2 Migration of Existing Applications

    In order to get an application designed for low DPI values running on a high
    resolution monitors quickly, consider one of the scaling options (let the
    application run as \e{DPI Unaware} on Windows or set the environment
    variable \c QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR to \c "1". These options may incur
    some scaling or painting artifacts, though.

    In the longer term, the application should be adapted to run unmodified:

    \list
        \li Always use the qreal versions of the QPainter drawing API.
        \li Size windows and dialogs in relation to the screen size.
        \li Replace hard-coded sizes in layouts and drawing code
            by values calculated from font metrics or screen size.
    \endlist

\title Scripting
\brief Qt's scripting features

Qt has three main ways to help make an application scriptable. All of them allow easy
integration of the \l{ECMAScript Reference}{ECMAScript} (more widely known as JavaScript) language into the application. Depending on how deep
the integration should be, one of these APIs can be used:

\section1 Qt Script Module
 \l {Qt Script} is a separate module, designed with scripting applications in mind. It has
 a mature and rich API that permits a really deep integration of scripting functionality. It allows
  evaluating and debugging of scripts, and advanced use of objects and functions. It also gives access to a really
 low level \l{ECMAScript Reference}{ECMAScript} engine API. Full documentation about using \l{Qt Script} to make an application
 scriptable can be found \l{Making Applications Scriptable}{here}.

\section1 JS API
This is a simple API, very similar to \l{Qt Script}, but limited to basic functionality. The main
 classes are QJSEngine and QJSValue, which can be used to embed pure \l{ECMAScript Reference}{ECMAScript} functionality
 like evaluating scripts and calling functions.

\section1 QML
\l{Qt QML}{QML} exposes a modified \l{ECMAScript Reference}{ECMAScript} environment. It is designed to mix well with the JavaScript
 API mentioned earlier. QML may be used without \l{Qt Quick} components, which may be useful for
 server side scripting. With QML it is possible to mix pure \l{ECMAScript Reference}{ECMAScript} and declarative components
 (\l{Use Case - Integrating JavaScript in QML}).

All of these three scripting solutions seamlessly inter-operate with \l{The Meta-Object System}{the Meta-Object System}, which means that all \l{Signals & Slots}{signals and slots} and
\l{The Property System}{properties} of a QObject instance are accessible in an \l{ECMAScript Reference}{ECMAScript} environment.

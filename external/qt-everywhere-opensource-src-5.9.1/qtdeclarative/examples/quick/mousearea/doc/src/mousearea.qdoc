    \ingroup qtquickexamples

    \e MouseArea example shows how to respond to clicks and drags with a
    \l MouseArea. For more information, visit
    \l{Important Concepts In Qt Quick - User Input}.

    \section1 MouseArea Behavior

    When you click inside the red square, the \l Text type will list several
    properties of that click which are available to QML. The opacity of the
    red square will be reduced while the mouse is pressed and remains inside
    the MouseArea.

    Signals are emitted by the MouseArea when clicks or other discrete
    operations occur within it.

    \l MouseArea can also be used to drag items around. By setting the
    parameters of the drag property, the target item will be dragged around if
    the user starts to drag within the mouse area boundary.

    \title Scene Graph - Custom Geometry
    \ingroup qtquickexamples
    \brief Shows how to implement a custom geometry in the Qt Quick Scene Graph.

    The custom geometry example shows how to create a QQuickItem which
    uses the scene graph API to build a custom geometry for the scene
    graph. It does this by creating a BezierCurve item which is made
    part of the CustomGeometry module and makes use of this in a QML
    file.

    \section1 BezierCurve Declaration

    \snippet scenegraph/customgeometry/beziercurve.h 1

    The item declaration subclasses the QQuickItem class and adds five
    properties. One for each of the four control points in the bezier
    curve and a parameter to control the number of segments the curve
    is subdivided into. For each of the properties we have
    corresponding getter and setter functions. Since these properties
    can be bound to in QML, it is also preferable to have notifier
    signals for each of them so changes will be picked up the QML
    engine and used accordingly.

    \snippet scenegraph/customgeometry/beziercurve.h 2

    The synchronization point between the QML scene and the rendering
    scene graph is the virtual function \l
    QQuickItem::updatePaintNode() which all items with custom scene
    graph logic must implement.

    \note The scene graph will on many hardware configurations be
    rendering on a separate thread. It is therefore crucial that
    interaction with the scene graph happens in a controlled manner,
    first and foremost through the \l QQuickItem::updatePaintNode()
    function.

    \section1 BezierCurve Implementation

    \snippet scenegraph/customgeometry/beziercurve.cpp 1

    The BezierCurve constructor sets up default values for the
    control points and the number of segments. The bezier curve
    is specified in normalized coordinates relative to the item's
    bounding rectangle.

    The constructor also sets the flag \l
    QQuickItem::ItemHasContents. This flags tells the canvas that this
    item provides visual content and will call \l
    QQuickItem::updatePaintNode() when it is time for the QML scene to
    be synchronized with the rendering scene graph.

    \snippet scenegraph/customgeometry/beziercurve.cpp 2

    The BezierCurve class has no data members that need to be cleaned
    up so the destructor does nothing. It is worth mentioning that the
    rendering scene graph is managed by the scene graph it self,
    potentially in a different thread, so one should never retain
    QSGNode references in the QQuickItem class nor try to clean them
    up explicitly.

    \snippet scenegraph/customgeometry/beziercurve.cpp 3

    The setter function for the p1 property checks if the value is
    unchanged and exits early if this is the case. Then it updates the
    internal value and emits the changed signal. It then proceeds to
    call the \l QQuickItem::update() function which will notify the
    rendering scene graph, that the state of this object has changed
    and needs to be synchronized with the rendering scene graph.
    A call to update() will result in a call to
    QQuickItem::updatePaintNode() at a later time.

    The other property setters are equivalent, and are omitted from
    this example.

    \snippet scenegraph/customgeometry/beziercurve.cpp 4

    The updatePaintNode() function is the primary integration point
    for synchronizing the state of the QML scene with the rendering
    scene graph. The function gets passed a QSGNode which is the
    instance that was returned on the last call to the function. It
    will be null the first time the function gets called and we create
    our QSGGeometryNode which we will fill with geometry and a
    material.

    \snippet scenegraph/customgeometry/beziercurve.cpp 5

    We then create the geometry and add it to the node. The first
    argument to the QSGGeometry constructor is a definition of the
    vertex type, called an "attribute set". Since the graphics often
    used in QML centers around a few common standard attribute sets,
    these are provided by default. Here we use the Point2D attribute
    set which has two floats, one for x coordinates and one for y
    coordinates. The second argument is the vertex count.

    Custom attribute sets can also created, but that is not
    covered in this example.

    Since we do not have any special needs for memory managing the
    geometry, we specify that the QSGGeometryNode should own the
    geometry.

    To minimize allocations, reduce memory fragmentation and
    improve performance, it would also be possible to make the
    geometry a member of a QSGGeometryNode subclass, in which case, we
    would not have set the QSGGeometryNode::OwnsGeometry flag.

    \snippet scenegraph/customgeometry/beziercurve.cpp 6

    The scene graph API provides a few commonly used material
    implementations. In this example we use the QSGFlatColorMaterial
    which will fill the shape defined by the geometry with a solid
    color. Again we pass the ownership of the material to the node, so
    it can be cleaned up by the scene graph.

    \snippet scenegraph/customgeometry/beziercurve.cpp 7

    In the case where the QML item has changed and we only want to
    modify the existing node's geometry, we cast the \c oldNode to a
    QSGGeometryNode instance and extract it's geometry. In case the
    segment count has changed, we call QSGGeometry::allocate() to make
    sure it has the right number of vertices.

    \snippet scenegraph/customgeometry/beziercurve.cpp 8

    To fill the geometry, we first extract the vertex array from
    it. Since we are using one of the default attribute sets, we can
    use the convenience function QSGGeometry::vertexDataAsPoint2D().
    Then we go through each segment and calculate its position and
    write that value to the vertex.

    \snippet scenegraph/customgeometry/beziercurve.cpp 9

    In the end of the function, we return the node so the scene graph
    can render it.

    \section1 Application Entry-Point

    \snippet scenegraph/customgeometry/main.cpp 1

    The application is a straightforward QML application, with a
    QGuiApplication and a QQuickView that we pass a .qml file. To make
    use of the BezierCurve item, we need to register it in the QML
    engine, using the qmlRegisterType() function. We give it the name
    BezierCurve and make it part of the \c {CustomGeometry 1.0}
    module.

    As the bezier curve is drawn using GL_LINE_STRIP, we specify that
    the view should be multisampled to get antialiasing. This is not
    required, but it will make the item look a bit nicer on hardware
    that supports it. Multisampling is not enabled by default because
    it often results in higher memory usage.

    \section1 Using the Item

    \snippet scenegraph/customgeometry/main.qml 1

    Our .qml file imports the \c {QtQuick 2.0} module to get the
    standard types and also our own \c {CustomGeometry 1.0} module
    which contains our newly created BezierCurve objects.

    \snippet scenegraph/customgeometry/main.qml 2

    Then we create the our root item and an instance of the
    BezierCurve which we anchor to fill the root.

    \snippet scenegraph/customgeometry/main.qml 3

    To make the example a bit more interesting we add an animation to
    change the two control points in the curve. The end points stay
    unchanged.

    \snippet scenegraph/customgeometry/main.qml 4

    Finally we overlay a short text outlining what the example shows.

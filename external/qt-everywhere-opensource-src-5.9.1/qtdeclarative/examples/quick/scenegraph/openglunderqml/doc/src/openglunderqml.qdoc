    \title Scene Graph - OpenGL Under QML
    \ingroup qtquickexamples
    \brief Shows how to render OpenGL under a Qt Quick scene.

    \image openglunderqml-example.jpg

    The OpenGL under QML example shows how an application can make use
    of the \l QQuickWindow::beforeRendering() signal to draw custom
    OpenGL content under a Qt Quick scene. This signal is emitted at
    the start of every frame, before the scene graph starts its
    rendering, thus any OpenGL draw calls that are made as a response
    to this signal, will stack under the Qt Quick items.

    As an alternative, applications that wish to render OpenGL content
    on top of the Qt Quick scene, can do so by connecting to the \l
    QQuickWindow::afterRendering() signal.

    In this example, we will also see how it is possible to have
    values that are exposed to QML which affect the OpenGL
    rendering. We animate the threshold value using a NumberAnimation
    in the QML file and this value is used by the OpenGL shader
    program that draws the squircles.

    First of all, we need an object we can expose to QML. This is a
    subclass of QQuickItem so we can easily access \l QQuickItem::window().

    \snippet scenegraph/openglunderqml/squircle.h 1

    Then we need an object to take care of the rendering. This
    instance needs to be separated from the QQuickItem because the
    item lives in the GUI thread and the rendering potentially happens
    on the render thread. Since we want to connect to \l
    QQuickWindow::beforeRendering(), we make the renderer a QObject.
    The renderer contains a copy of all the state it needs,
    independent of the GUI thread.

    \note Don't be tempted to merge the two objects into
    one. QQuickItems may be deleted on the GUI thread while the render
    thread is rendering.

    Lets move on to the implementation.

    \snippet scenegraph/openglunderqml/squircle.cpp 7

    The constructor of the \c Squircle class simply initializes the
    values and connects to the window changed signal which we will use
    to prepare our renderer.

    \snippet scenegraph/openglunderqml/squircle.cpp 1

    Once we have a window, we attach to the \l
    QQuickWindow::beforeSynchronizing() signal which we will use to
    create the renderer and to copy state into it safely. We also
    connect to the \l QQuickWindow::sceneGraphInvalidated() signal to
    handle the cleanup of the renderer.

    \note Since the Squircle object has affinity to the GUI thread and
    the signals are emitted from the rendering thread, it is crucial
    that the connections are made with \l
    Qt::DirectConnection. Failing to do so, will result in that the
    slots are invoked on the wrong thread with no OpenGL context
    present.

    \snippet scenegraph/openglunderqml/squircle.cpp 3

    The default behavior of the scene graph is to clear the
    framebuffer before rendering. Since we render before the scene
    graph, we need to turn this clearing off. This means that we need
    to clear ourselves in the \c paint() function.

    \snippet scenegraph/openglunderqml/squircle.cpp 9

    We use the \c sync() function to initialize the renderer and to
    copy the state in our item into the renderer. When the renderer is
    created, we also connect the \l QQuickWindow::beforeRendering() to
    the renderer's \c paint() slot.

    \note The \l QQuickWindow::beforeSynchronizing() signal is emitted
    on the rendering thread while the GUI thread is blocked, so it is
    safe to simply copy the value without any additional protection.

    \snippet scenegraph/openglunderqml/squircle.cpp 6

    In the \c cleanup() function we delete the renderer which in turn
    cleans up its own resources.

    \snippet scenegraph/openglunderqml/squircle.cpp 8

    When the value of \c t changes, we call \l QQuickWindow::update()
    rather than \l QQuickItem::update() because the former will force
    the entire window to be redrawn, even when the scene graph has not
    changed since the last frame.

    \snippet scenegraph/openglunderqml/squircle.cpp 4

    In the SquircleRenderer's \c paint() function we start by
    initializing the shader program. By initializing the shader
    program here, we make sure that the OpenGL context is bound and
    that we are on the correct thread.

    \snippet scenegraph/openglunderqml/squircle.cpp 5

    We use the shader program to draw the squircle. At the end of the
    \c paint function we release the program and disable the
    attributes we used so that the OpenGL context is in a "clean"
    state for the scene graph to pick it up.

    \note If tracking the changes in the OpenGL context's state is not
    feasible, one can use the function \l
    QQuickWindow::resetOpenGLState() which will reset all state that
    the scene graph relies on.

    \snippet scenegraph/openglunderqml/main.cpp 1

    The application's \c main() function instantiates a QQuickView and
    launches the \c main.qml file. The only thing worth noting is that
    we export the \c Squircle class to QML using the \l
    qmlRegisterType() macro.

    \snippet scenegraph/openglunderqml/main.qml 1

    We import the Squircle QML type with the name we registered in the
    \c main() function. We then instantiate it and create a running
    NumberAnimation on its \c t property.

    \snippet scenegraph/openglunderqml/main.qml 2

    Then we overlay a short descriptive text, so that it is clearly
    visible that we are in fact rendering OpenGL under our Qt Quick
    scene.

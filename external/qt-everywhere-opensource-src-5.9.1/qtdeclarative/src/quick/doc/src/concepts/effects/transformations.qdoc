\title Qt Quick Transformation Types
\brief Types for applying transformations to visual types

Transformations are applied to child hierarchies and also will also transform
mouse and touch input so coordinates in event handlers behave as expected.

\section1 Item Properties

The \l {Item} contains a number of convenience properties,
covering the most common types of transformations.

\list
  \li \c {x} and \c{y}; Translates the item.
  \li \c {scale}; Applies a uniform scale factor to the item.
  \li \c {rotation}; Applies a counterclockwise rotation of the item.
  \li \c {transformOrigin}; Used in conjunction with scale and rotation to
         change the origin of the transformation.
\endlist

\section1 Transform List

In addition to the convenience types, it is possible to define more
comprehensive transformations using a list of
\l {Scale}, \l {Rotation},
and \l {Translate} objects to the \c {transform}
property of the \l {Item}.

Types that animate properties based on data types
\annotatedlist qtquick-animation-properties

Animations are created by applying animation types to property
values. Animation types will interpolate property values to create smooth
transitions. As well, state transitions may assign animations to state changes.

To create an animation, use an appropriate animation type for the type of
the property that is to be animated, and apply the animation depending on the
type of behavior that is required.

\sa {Qt Quick Examples - Animation}

\section1 Triggering Animations

There are several ways of setting animation to an object.

\section2 Direct Property Animation

Animations are created by applying animation objects to property values to
gradually change the properties over time. These \e {property animations} apply
smooth movements by interpolating values between property value changes. Property
animations provide timing controls and allows different interpolations through
\l{qml-easing-animation}{easing curves}.

\snippet qml/animation.qml property animation

Specialized property animation types
have more efficient implementations than the \l{PropertyAnimation} type. They
are for setting animations to different QML types such as \c int, \c color, and
rotations. Similarly, the \l{ParentAnimation} can animate parent changes.

See the \l {qml-controlling-animations}{Controlling Animations} section for more
information about the different animation properties.


\section2 Using Predefined Targets and Properties

In the previous example, the PropertyAnimation and NumberAnimation objects needed
to specify particular \l {PropertyAnimation::}{target} and \l {PropertyAnimation::}{properties}
values to specify the objects and properties that should be animated. This can be
avoided by using the \e {<Animation> on <Property>} syntax, which specifies the
animation is to be applied as a \e {property value source}.

Below are two PropertyAnimation objects that are specified using this syntax:

\qml
import QtQuick 2.0

Rectangle {
    id: rect
    width: 100; height: 100
    color: "red"

    PropertyAnimation on x { to: 100 }
    PropertyAnimation on y { to: 100 }
}
\endqml

The animation starts as soon as the rectangle is loaded, and will automatically be
applied to its \c x and \c y values. Since the \e {<Animation> on <Property>}
syntax has been used, it is not necessary to set the
\l {PropertyAnimation::}{target} value of the PropertyAnimation objects to
\c rect, and neither is it necessary to set the \l {PropertyAnimation::}{property}
values to \c x and \c y.

This can also be used by \l{Playing Animations in Parallel or in Sequence}
{grouped animations} to ensure that all animations within a group are applied to
the same property.  For example, the previous example could instead use
SequentialAnimation to animate the rectangle's \c color first to yellow, then
to blue:

\qml
import QtQuick 2.0

Rectangle {
    width: 100; height: 100
    color: "red"

    SequentialAnimation on color {
        ColorAnimation { to: "yellow"; duration: 1000 }
        ColorAnimation { to: "blue"; duration: 1000 }
    }
}
\endqml

Since the SequentialAnimation object has been specified on the \c color property
using the \e {<Animation> on <Property>} syntax, its child ColorAnimation objects
are also automatically applied to this property and do not need to specify
\l {PropertyAnimation::}{target} or \l {PropertyAnimation::}{property} animation
values.


\target qml-transition-animations
\section2 Transitions during State Changes

\l{State}{Qt Quick States} are property configurations where a property may have different values to reflect different states. State changes introduce
abrupt property changes; animations smooth transitions to produce visually
appealing state changes.

The \l{Transition} type can contain animation types to interpolate property changes
caused by state changes. To assign the transition to an object, bind it to the
\c transitions property.

A button might have two states, the \c pressed state when the user clicks on the
button and a \c released state when the user releases the button. We can assign
different property configurations for each state. A transition would animate the
change from the \c pressed state to the \c released state. Likewise, there would
be an animation during the change from the \c released state to the \c pressed
state.

\snippet qml/animation.qml transition animation

Binding the \c to and \c from properties to the state's name will assign that
particular transition to the state change. For simple or symmetric transitions,
setting the to \c to property to the wild card symbol, "\c{*}", denotes
that the transition applies to any state change.

\snippet qml/animation.qml wildcard animation

\section2 Default Animation as Behaviors

Default property animations are set using \e {behavior animations}. Animations
declared in \l {Behavior} types apply to the property and animates any
property value changes. However, Behavior types have an
\c enabled property to purposely enable or disable the behavior animations.

A ball component might have a behavior animation assigned to its \c x, \c y, and
\c color properties. The behavior animation could be set up to simulate an
elastic effect. In effect, this behavior animation would apply the elastic
effect to the properties whenever the ball moves.

\snippet qml/animation.qml behavior animation

There are several methods of assigning behavior animations to properties. The
\c{Behavior on <property>} declaration is a convenient way of assigning a
behavior animation onto a property.

See the \l {Qt Quick Examples - Animation} for a
demonstration of behavioral animations.

\section1 Playing Animations in Parallel or in Sequence

Animations can run \e {in parallel} or \e {in sequence}. Parallel animations
will play a group of animations at the same time while sequential animations
play a group of animations in order: one after the other. Grouping animations in
\l{SequentialAnimation} and \l{ParallelAnimation} will play the animations in
sequence or in parallel.

A banner component may have several icons or slogans to display, one after the
other. The \c opacity property could transform to \c 1.0 denoting an opaque
object. Using the \l{SequentialAnimation} type, the opacity animations will
play after the preceding animation finishes. The \l{ParallelAnimation} type
will play the animations at the same time.

\snippet qml/animation.qml sequential animation

Once individual animations are placed into a SequentialAnimation or
ParallelAnimation, they can no longer be started and stopped independently. The
sequential or parallel animation must be started and stopped as a group.

The \l SequentialAnimation type is also useful for playing
\l{qml-transition-animations}{transition animations} because animations are
played in parallel inside transitions.

\target qml-controlling-animations
\section1 Controlling Animations

There are different methods to control animations.

\section2 Animation Playback
All animation types inherit from the \l Animation type. It is not
possible to create \l Animation objects; instead, this type provides the
essential properties and methods for animation types. Animation types have
\c{start()}, \c{stop()}, \c{resume()}, \c{pause()}, \c {restart()}, and
\c{complete()} -- all of these methods control the execution of animations.

\target qml-easing-animation
\section2 Easing

Easing curves define how the animation will interpolate between the start value
and the end value. Different easing curves might go beyond the defined range of
interpolation. The easing curves simplify the creation of animation effects such
as bounce effects, acceleration, deceleration, and cyclical animations.

A QML object may have different easing curve for each property animation. There
are also different parameters to control the curve, some of which are exclusive
to a particular curve. For more information about the easing curves, visit the
\l {PropertyAnimation::easing.type}{easing} documentation.

The \l{animation/easing}{easing example} visually demonstrates each
of the different easing types.

\section2 Other Animation Types

In addition, QML provides several other types useful for animation:

\list
\li PauseAnimation: enables pauses during animations
\li ScriptAction: allows JavaScript to be executed during an animation, and can
be used together with StateChangeScript to reused existing scripts
\li PropertyAction: changes a property \e immediately during an animation,
without animating the property change
\endlist

These are specialized animation types that animate different property types
\list
\li SmoothedAnimation: a specialized NumberAnimation that provides smooth
changes in animation when the target value changes
\li SpringAnimation: provides a spring-like animation with specialized
attributes such as \l {SpringAnimation::}{mass},
\l{SpringAnimation::}{damping} and \l{SpringAnimation::}{epsilon}
\li ParentAnimation: used for animating a parent change (see ParentChange)
\li AnchorAnimation: used for animating an anchor change (see AnchorChanges)
\endlist

\section1 Sharing Animation Instances

Sharing animation instances between Transitions or Behaviors is not
supported, and may lead to undefined behavior. In the following example,
changes to the Rectangle's position will most likely not be correctly animated.

\qml
Rectangle {
    // NOT SUPPORTED: this will not work correctly as both Behaviors
    // try to control a single animation instance
    NumberAnimation { id: anim; duration: 300; easing.type: Easing.InBack }
    Behavior on x { animation: anim }
    Behavior on y { animation: anim }
}
\endqml

The easiest fix is to repeat the NumberAnimation for both Behaviors. If the repeated
animation is rather complex, you might also consider creating a custom animation
component and assigning an instance to each Behavior, for example:

\qml
// MyNumberAnimation.qml
NumberAnimation { id: anim; duration: 300; easing.type: Easing.InBack }
\endqml

\qml
// main.qml
Rectangle {
    Behavior on x { MyNumberAnimation {} }
    Behavior on y { MyNumberAnimation {} }
}
\endqml

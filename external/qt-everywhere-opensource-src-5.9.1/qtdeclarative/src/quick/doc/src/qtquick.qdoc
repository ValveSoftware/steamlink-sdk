\title Qt Quick
\brief The Qt Quick module implements the "standard library" for QML

The Qt Quick module is the standard library for writing QML applications.
While the \l{Qt QML} module provides the QML engine and
language infrastructure, the Qt Quick module provides all the basic
types necessary for creating user interfaces with QML. It
provides a visual canvas and includes types for creating and animating
visual components, receiving user input, creating data models and views
and delayed object instantiation.

The Qt Quick module provides both a \l{Qt Quick QML Types}{QML API} which supplies
QML types for creating user interfaces with the QML language, and a
\l{Qt Quick C++ Classes}{C++ API} for extending QML applications with C++ code.

\note A set of Qt Quick-based UI controls is also available to create user
interfaces. See \l{Qt Quick Controls} for more information.

For those new to QML and Qt Quick, please see
\l{QML Applications}
for an introduction to writing QML applications.

\section1 Important Concepts in Qt Quick

Qt Quick provides everything needed to create a rich application with a fluid
and dynamic user interface. It enables user interfaces to be built around the
behavior of user interface components and how they connect with one another,
and it provides a visual canvas with its own coordinate system and rendering
engine. Animation and transition effects are a first class concept in Qt Quick,
and visual effects can be supplemented through specialized components for
particle and shader effects.

When using the \c QtQuick module, you will need to know how to write QML
applications using the QML language. In particular, QML Basics and QML
Essentials from the \l{QML Applications} page.

To find out more about using the QML language, see the \l{Qt QML} module documentation.

\title Creating C++ Plugins for QML
\brief Description of how to write C++ plugins for QML

\section1 Creating a Plugin

    The \l{QQmlEngine}{QML engine} loads C++ plugins for QML.
    Such plugins are usually provided in a QML extension module, and can
    provide types for use by clients in QML documents which import the module.
    A module requires at least one type registered in order to be considered
    valid.

    \include qqmlextensionplugin.qdocinc

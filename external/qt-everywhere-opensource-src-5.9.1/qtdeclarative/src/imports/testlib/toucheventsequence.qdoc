    \qmltype TouchEventSequence
    \inqmlmodule QtTest
    \ingroup qtquicktest
    \brief TouchEventSequence is used to build and dispatch touch events
    for testing.

    \since 5.9

    A TouchEventSequence is created by calling \l [QML] {TestCase::touchEvent()}{TestCase.touchEvent()}.
    The type can not be directly instantiated. Each method provided by the type returns
    the same object, allowing chained calls.

    For example:
    \code
        touchEvent(item).press(0).commit();
    \endcode
    is equivalent to:
    \code
        var sequence = touchEvent(item);
        sequence.press(0);
        sequence.commit();
    \endcode

    Events are delivered to the window which contains the item specified in touchEvent.

    \sa TestCase::touchEvent(), QTest::QTouchEventSequence
*/

/*!
    \qmlmethod TouchEventSequence TouchEventSequence::press(int touchId, object item, real x = item.width / 2, real y = item.height / 2)

    Creates a new point identified as \a touchId, at the point indicated by \a x and \a y relative to \a item.
    Further use of the same touch point should maintain the same touchId.

    Item defaults to the value provided via touchEvent().
    X and y default to the midpoint of the item.
*/

/*!
    \qmlmethod TouchEventSequence TouchEventSequence::move(int touchId, object item, real x = item.width / 2, real y = item.height / 2)

    Moves \a touchId to the point indicated by \a x and \a y relative to \a item.

    Item defaults to the value provided via touchEvent().
    X and y default to the midpoint of the item.
*/

/*!
    \qmlmethod TouchEventSequence TouchEventSequence::release(int touchId, object item, real x = item.width / 2, real y = item.height / 2)

    Removes \a touchId at the point indicated by \a x and \a y relative to \a item.

    Item defaults to the value provided via touchEvent().
    X and y default to the midpoint of the item.
*/

/*!
    \qmlmethod TouchEventSequence TouchEventSequence::stationary(int touchId)

    Indicates that \a touchId is present but otherwise unchanged from prior events.
*/

/*!
    \qmlmethod TouchEventSequence TouchEventSequence::commit()

    Sends the touch event composed by prior use of press(), move(), release(), and stationary().
    Following commit's return, the TouchEventSequence can be used to compose a new event.

    \code
        var sequence = touchEvent(target);
        // Touch the middle of target with 1 point
        sequence.press(1);
        sequence.commit();

        // Begin a new event
        // Move the point to target's upper left corner
        sequence.move(1, target, 0, 0);
        sequence.commit();
    \endcode

    Commit is automatically invoked when the TouchEventSequence object is destroyed.

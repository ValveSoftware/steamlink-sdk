(PA_COMMAND_GET_CARD_INFO)

    uint32 available

The field is added once for every profile.

## v30, implemented by >= 6.0
#
A new protocol mechanism supported: Two ringbuffers in shared memory.
Pulseaudio fdsem (wrappers around event file descriptors) are used for
signalling new data.
The protocol has a new SHM flag telling whether a SHM memblock is writable
by both sides.

PA_COMMAND_ENABLE_SRBCHANNEL
First sent from server to client, tells the client to start listening on
the additional SHM ringbuffer channel.
This command also has ancillary data (two eventfds attached to it).
Must be directly followed by a memblock which is the ringbuffer memory.
When memblock is received by the client, it acks by sending
PA_COMMAND_ENABLE_SRBCHANNEL back (without ancillary or memblock data).

PA_COMMAND_DISABLE_SRBCHANNEL
Tells the client to stop listening on the additional SHM ringbuffer channel.
Acked by client by sending PA_COMMAND_DISABLE_SRBCHANNEL back.

#### If you just changed the protocol, read this
## module-tunnel depends on the sink/source/sink-input/source-input protocol
## internals, so if you changed these, you might have broken module-tunnel.
## Don't forget to test module-tunnel-{source,sink} when pushing protocol
## changes.

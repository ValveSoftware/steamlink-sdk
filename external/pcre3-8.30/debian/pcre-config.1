.TP
\fB--version\fR

.TP
\fB--libs\fR
Writes to standard output the command line options required to link
with PCRE (e.g. \fI-lpcre\fR).
.TP
\fB--libs-posix\fR
Writes to standard output the command line options required to link
with the PCRE POSIX emulation library (e.g. \fI-lpcreposix -lpcre\fR).
.TP
\fB--cflags\fR
Writes to standard output the command line options required to compile 
files that use PCRE (this often includes some \fI-I\fR options, but is blank 
on debian systems).
.TP
\fB--cflags-posix\fR
Writes to standard output the command line options required to compile
files that use the PCRE POSIX emulation library (this often includes
some -I options, but is blank on debian systems). Suppress printing of

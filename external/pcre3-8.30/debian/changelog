pcre3 (1:8.30-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * There is no use in including debug information for the libraries from
    the udeb in the debug package; more importantly, because the
    installation system isn't multiarch, if they are included they result
    in arch specific files in arch independent paths (debug package is 
    Multi-arch:same). Removed. (Closes: #670018)

pcre3 (1:8.30-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Reluctantly using an epoch, as it seems the funny version number with
    extra dots causes problems
  * Bumped standard version to 3.9.3. No changes needed
  * Converted to use new source format / quilt
  * Put back obsolete pcre_info() API that upstream have dropped (Closes:
    #665300, #665356)
  * Don't include pcregrep binary in debug package

  Thanks to Elimar Riesebieter for the conversion to the new source format.

pcre3 (8.30..-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * configure: fixed libpcreposix version (this is not the same bug as the
    previous one, though it's in the same few lines)

 -- Mark Baker <mark@mnb.org.uk>  Thu, 22 Mar 2012 19:45:03 +0000

pcre3 (8.30..-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * configure: Correct library version so soname is libpcre.so.3 instead
    of .2 (Closes: #664983)
  * Horrible version number is because of NMU of "8.30.really8.12-1.1";
    this will sort between that and 8.31-1

  * Overloaded RE::Init(), for compatibility with PCRE 6.x API (Closes
    #436210). Thanks to Matthias Klose for the patch.
  * Increased shlibdeps from 4.5 to 6.0. 6.0 introduced a new function
    (pcre_compile2) to the API, so anything using that requires at least
    6.0. (Closes #441345)

    for zpcregrp (Closes: #197899)
  * debian/control: Change package descriptions (Closes: #209904)
  * debian/rules and others: Renamed pgrep package to pcregrep, to match
    name of binary and avoid confusion with pgrep (which greps for
    processes, and is in the procps package; a dummy pgrep package will
    ease upgrades (Closes: #217076)

 -- Mark Baker <mark@mnb.org.uk>  Wed, 25 Feb 2004 20:49:33 +0000

pcre3 (4.3-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/libpcre3.files: include pcrepattern(3) manpage in libpcre3
    package instead of libpcre3-dev package. This means that anyone using
    a PCRE based application will have the man page available.

 -- Mark Baker <mark@mnb.org.uk>  Thu,  8 Jan 2004 21:19:51 +0000

pcre3 (4.3-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * ltmain.sh: Replaced with standard version from debian libtool package,
    but with Phil Hazel's patch applied (although I suspect his patch
    isn't necessary on debian systems). (Closes: #198147, #198668) I hope.

 -- Mark Baker <mark@mnb.org.uk>  Wed, 25 Jun 2003 21:09:22 +0100

pcre3 (4.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * pcretest.c: Cheat at test! Always print 40 instead of the size,
    because the size varies on different architectures, and we don't
    really want to fail the test because of this.

 -- Mark Baker <mark@mnb.org.uk>  Thu, 19 Jun 2003 21:00:39 +0100

pcre3 (4.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This release is entirely the work of Andreas Metzler <ametzler@debian.org>.
  Thanks Andreas.  

  * new upstream version (Closes: 182570)
  * this version apparently fixes infinite loop bug (Closes: 161184)
  * repacked using debhelper and upstream's Makefile. Switch to libtool's
    versioning scheme, see debian/README.Versioning.libtool for details.
    (Closes: #187371)
  * (however, don't ship .la files, they only give libtool strange ideas, see
    http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2003/debian-devel-200304/msg00827.html
    for an example.)
  * changed compile-options to really follow policy 3.5.7
  * debian/control: changed description to say "Perl 5" as Perl 6, when it
    eventually appears, will have yet another different regex syntax
    (Closes: #166939)

  * New upstream version (Closes: #119429, #161424)
  * Added zpcregrep script by Samuel Tardieu (Closes: #36897)
  * doc/pcregrep.1: mention zpcregrep
  * debian/rules: use && in test rule rather than -a option to test, for
    better POSIX compatibility (Closes: #158775)
  * debian/Makefile: build pcretest once with -rpath for doing tests, and
    once without, so that:
  * debian/rules: install pcretest program (Closes: #162998)
  * Don't create or remove /usr/doc/foo symlinks. This means that none of
    the packages have prerms and only libpcre3 has a postinst
  * debian/copyright: corrected to "Debian GNU/Linux"
  * debian/control: standards version updated to 3.5.7.0
  * debian/rules: strip comment and note sections from libraries
  * The result of the last four changes is that it should now be
    lintian-clean apart from one caused by a known bug in lintian (see
    lintian bug #117260) (Closes: #162999)

    dying (closes: #108661, #108891).

pcre3 (3.3-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: install pcregrep as that name (only) rather than as
    pgrep with a symlink called pcregrep. This avoids a name clash with

    pcregrep.

  * debian/rules: manpage pgrep.1.gz should not be installed as executable!
  * debian/rules: pcregrep.1.gz is symlink to pgrep.1.gz
  * doc/pcre-config.1: basic manpage for pcre-config written
  * debian/rules: install pcre-config.1
  * debian/rules: use -isp option to dpkg-gencontrol

pcre2 (2.07-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * new upstream version
  * pcre.c, pcre.h: new upstream version is incompatible with old one! I've 
    done a nasty hack so that old binaries will still work. Old source won't, 
    but at least it won't fail silently so this shouldn't be a major problem.
  * debian/rules: /usr/doc/pgrep should be a link to libpcre2, not libpcre1

pcre2 (2.02-2) unstable; urgency=low

 -- Mark Baker <mbaker@iee.org>  Fri, 29 Jan 1999 00:12:00 +0000

pcre (1.09-2) unstable; urgency=low

  What follows is the changelog from pcre 1, up to the point where the pcre2
  package was made.

  The changes are not that large but the API, and therefore the ABI, are
  changed so version 2 is not compatible.

  * pcreposix.c,pcreposix.h: prefixed function names with pcreposix_
  * pcreposix.h: #defines so un-prefixed names can be used
  * These mean pcre routines will be used instead of the regex library
    built into libc (#22525)
  * debian/shlibs: pcreposix needs libpcre1 >=1.09-2 now
  * debian/rules: it's not pcre 1.01 any more.

Methods		object CreateProxyConfiguration(dict settings)

			This method allows system daemons handling Internet
			connections and that also use Web Proxy Autodiscovery
			Protocol (WPAD) to configure PAC URLs.

			Valid settings for configuration are these:

			string Method [mandatory]

				The method of proxy configuration. Valid
				values are "direct", "manual" and "auto".

				For "direct" no proxy is used. Using this
				value just allows for reference configuration
				since it makes no difference compared to not
				having any proxy settings at all.

				The "auto" configuration requires to have
				the URL setting filled in and be valud.

			string URL [optional]

				URL for the PAC file. The URL must be
				fully qualified.

				Example: "http://wpad.connman.net/wpad.dat"

			string Script [optional]

				PAC script as text string. The script must
				be valid Javascript with FindProxyForURL()
				function.

				Example:

				function FindProxyForURL(url, host)
				{
					return "DIRECT";
				}

			array{string} Servers [optional]

				List of proxy servers. This value is only
				valid when method is set to "manual".

			array{string} Excludes [optional]

				List of hosts to exclude from proxy lookup.

			string Interface [optional]

				Interface name like "wlan0" etc. to provide
				consistent results for myIpAddress function.

			boolean BrowserOnly [optional]

				If this value is set, proxy configuration will
				be used for only browser schemes. If no Key is
				received PACrunner assumes FALSE by default.

			array{string} Domains [optional]

				Domain names and IP range for which this proxy
				configuration shall be valid. IP range should
				be in CIDR format. eg:"192.168.1.0/12" for IPv4
				and similarly for IPv6.

			array{string} Nameservers [optional]

				List of nameservers for this configuration.

				This value is needed for dnsResolve function
				in PAC files.

			On successful configuration of this method returns
			an object path that uniquely identifies this specific
			configuration.

		void DestroyProxyConfiguration(object config)

			This method allows to remove a previously configured
			proxy configuration. The object path to use is the
			one returned from CreateProxyConfiguration.

			A proxy configuration is only valid for the lifetime
			of the application creating it. In case it disconnects
			from the bus, the configuration will be automatically
			removed.

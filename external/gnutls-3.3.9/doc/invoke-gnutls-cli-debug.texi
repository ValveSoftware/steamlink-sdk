TLS debug client. It sets up multiple TLS connections to 
a server and queries its capabilities. It was created to assist in debugging 
GnuTLS, but it might be useful to extract a TLS server's capabilities.
It connects to a TLS server, performs tests and print the server's 
capabilities. If called with the `-v' parameter more checks will be performed.
Can be used to check for servers with special needs or bugs.

@cindex gnutls-cli-debug help

This is the automatically generated usage text for gnutls-cli-debug.

The text printed is the same whether selected with the @code{help} option
(@option{--help}) or the @code{more-help} option (@option{--more-help}).  @code{more-help} will print
the usage text by passing it through a pager program.
@code{more-help} is disabled on platforms without a working
@code{fork(2)} function.  The @code{PAGER} environment variable is
used to select the program, defaulting to @file{more}.  Both will exit
with a status code of 0.

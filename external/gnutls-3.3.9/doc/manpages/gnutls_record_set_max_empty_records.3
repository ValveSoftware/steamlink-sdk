.SH NAME
gnutls_record_set_max_empty_records \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "void gnutls_record_set_max_empty_records(gnutls_session_t " session ", const unsigned int " i ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.IP "const unsigned int i" 12
is the desired value of maximum empty records that can be accepted in a row.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Used to set the maximum number of empty fragments that can be accepted
in a row. Accepting many empty fragments is useful for receiving length\-hidden
content, where empty fragments filled with pad are sent to hide the real
length of a message. However, a malicious peer could send empty fragments to
mount a DoS attack, so as a safety measure, a maximum number of empty fragments
is accepted by default. If you know your application must accept a given number
of empty fragments in a row, you can use this function to set the desired value.

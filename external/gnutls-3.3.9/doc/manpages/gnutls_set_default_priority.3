.SH NAME
gnutls_set_default_priority \- API function
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>
.sp
.BI "int gnutls_set_default_priority(gnutls_session_t " session ");"
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP "gnutls_session_t session" 12
is a \fBgnutls_session_t\fP structure.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Sets some default priority on the ciphers, key exchange methods,
macs and compression methods.

This typically sets a default priority that is considered
sufficiently secure to establish encrypted sessions.

This function is kept around for backwards compatibility, but
because of its wide use it is still fully supported.  If you wish
to allow users to provide a string that specify which ciphers to
use (which is recommended), you should use
\fBgnutls_priority_set_direct()\fP or \fBgnutls_priority_set()\fP instead.
.SH "RETURNS"
\fBGNUTLS_E_SUCCESS\fP on success, or an error code.
.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bugs@gnutls.org>.

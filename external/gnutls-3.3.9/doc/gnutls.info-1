1 Preface
*********

This document demonstrates and explains the GnuTLS library API. A brief
introduction to the protocols and the technology involved is also
included so that an application programmer can better understand the
GnuTLS purpose and actual offerings.  Even if GnuTLS is a typical
library software, it operates over several security and cryptographic
protocols which require the programmer to make careful and correct usage
of them.  Otherwise it is likely to only obtain a false sense of
security.  The term of security is very broad even if restricted to
computer software, and cannot be confined to a single cryptographic
library.  For that reason, do not consider any program secure just
because it uses GnuTLS; there are several ways to compromise a program
or a communication line and GnuTLS only helps with some of them.

Although this document tries to be self contained, basic network
programming and public key infrastructure (PKI) knowledge is assumed in
most of it.  A good introduction to networking can be found in
[_STEVENS_], to public key infrastructure in [_GUTPKI_] and to security
engineering in [_ANDERSON_].

Updated versions of the GnuTLS software and this document will be
available from <http://www.gnutls.org/>.

2 Introduction to GnuTLS
************************

In brief GnuTLS can be described as a library which offers an API to
access secure communication protocols.  These protocols provide privacy
over insecure lines, and were designed to prevent eavesdropping,
tampering, or message forgery.

Technically GnuTLS is a portable ANSI C based library which implements
the protocols ranging from SSL 3.0 to TLS 1.2 (see *note Introduction to
TLS::, for a detailed description of the protocols), accompanied with
the required framework for authentication and public key infrastructure.
Important features of the GnuTLS library include:

   * Support for TLS 1.2, TLS 1.1, TLS 1.0 and SSL 3.0 protocols.

   * Support for Datagram TLS 1.0 and 1.2.

   * Support for handling and verification of X.509 and OpenPGP
     certificates.

   * Support for password authentication using TLS-SRP.

   * Support for keyed authentication using TLS-PSK.

   * Support for TPM, PKCS #11 tokens and smart-cards.

The GnuTLS library consists of three independent parts, namely the "TLS
protocol part", the "Certificate part", and the "Cryptographic back-end"
part.  The "TLS protocol part" is the actual protocol implementation,
and is entirely implemented within the GnuTLS library.  The "Certificate
part" consists of the certificate parsing, and verification functions
and it uses functionality from the libtasn1 library.  The "Cryptographic
back-end" is provided by the nettle and gmplib libraries.

2.1 Downloading and installing
==============================

GnuTLS is available for download at:
<http://www.gnutls.org/download.html>

GnuTLS uses a development cycle where even minor version numbers
indicate a stable release and a odd minor version number indicate a
development release.  For example, GnuTLS 1.6.3 denote a stable release
since 6 is even, and GnuTLS 1.7.11 denote a development release since 7
is odd.

GnuTLS depends on 'nettle' and 'gmplib', and you will need to install it
before installing GnuTLS. The 'nettle' library is available from
<http://www.lysator.liu.se/~nisse/nettle/>, while 'gmplib' is available
from <http://www.gmplib.org/>.  Don't forget to verify the cryptographic
signature after downloading source code packages.

The package is then extracted, configured and built like many other
packages that use Autoconf.  For detailed information on configuring and
building it, refer to the 'INSTALL' file that is part of the
distribution archive.  Typically you invoke './configure' and then 'make
check install'.  There are a number of compile-time parameters, as
discussed below.

Several parts of GnuTLS require ASN.1 functionality, which is provided
by a library called libtasn1.  A copy of libtasn1 is included in GnuTLS.
If you want to install it separately (e.g., to make it possibly to use
libtasn1 in other programs), you can get it from
<http://www.gnu.org/software/libtasn1/>.

The compression library, 'libz', the PKCS #11 helper library 'p11-kit',
as well as the TPM library 'trousers', are optional dependencies.  You
may get libz from <http://www.zlib.net/>, p11-kit from
<http://p11-glue.freedesktop.org/> and trousers from
<http://trousers.sourceforge.net/>.

A few 'configure' options may be relevant, summarized below.  They
disable or enable particular features, to create a smaller library with
only the required features.  Note however, that although a smaller
library is generated, the included programs are not guaranteed to
compile if some of these options are given.

--disable-srp-authentication
--disable-psk-authentication
--disable-anon-authentication
--disable-openpgp-authentication
--disable-dhe
--disable-ecdhe
--disable-openssl-compatibility
--disable-dtls-srtp-support
--disable-alpn-support
--disable-heartbeat-support
--disable-libdane
--without-p11-kit
--without-tpm
--without-zlib


For the complete list, refer to the output from 'configure --help'.

3 Introduction to TLS and DTLS
******************************

TLS stands for "Transport Layer Security" and is the successor of SSL,
the Secure Sockets Layer protocol [_SSL3_] designed by Netscape.  TLS is
an Internet protocol, defined by IETF(1), described in [_RFC5246_].  The
protocol provides confidentiality, and authentication layers over any
reliable transport layer.  The description, above, refers to TLS 1.0 but
applies to all other TLS versions as the differences between the
protocols are not major.

The DTLS protocol, or "Datagram TLS" [_RFC4347_] is a protocol with
identical goals as TLS, but can operate under unreliable transport
layers such as UDP.  The discussions below apply to this protocol as
well, except when noted otherwise.

3.1 TLS layers
==============

TLS is a layered protocol, and consists of the record protocol, the
handshake protocol and the alert protocol.  The record protocol is to
serve all other protocols and is above the transport layer.  The record
protocol offers symmetric encryption, data authenticity, and optionally
compression.  The alert protocol offers some signaling to the other
protocols.  It can help informing the peer for the cause of failures and
other error conditions.  *Note The Alert Protocol::, for more
information.  The alert protocol is above the record protocol.

The handshake protocol is responsible for the security parameters'
negotiation, the initial key exchange and authentication.  *Note The
Handshake Protocol::, for more information about the handshake protocol.
The protocol layering in TLS is shown in *note Figure 3.1:
fig-tls-layers.

3.2 The transport layer
=======================

TLS is not limited to any transport layer and can be used above any
transport layer, as long as it is a reliable one.  DTLS can be used over
reliable and unreliable transport layers.  GnuTLS supports TCP and UDP
layers transparently using the Berkeley sockets API. However, any
transport layer can be used by providing callbacks for GnuTLS to access
the transport layer (for details see *note Setting up the transport
layer::).


File: gnutls.info,  Node: The TLS record protocol,  Next: The TLS Alert Protocol,  Prev: The transport layer,  Up: Introduction to TLS

3.3 The TLS record protocol
===========================

The record protocol is the secure communications provider.  Its purpose
is to encrypt, authenticate and --optionally-- compress packets.  The
record layer functions can be called at any time after the handshake
process is finished, when there is need to receive or send data.  In
DTLS however, due to re-transmission timers used in the handshake
out-of-order handshake data might be received for some time (maximum 60
seconds) after the handshake process is finished.

The functions to access the record protocol are limited to send and
receive functions, which might, given the importance of this protocol in
TLS, seem awkward.  This is because the record protocol's parameters are
all set by the handshake protocol.  The record protocol initially starts
with NULL parameters, which means no encryption, and no MAC is used.
Encryption and authentication begin just after the handshake protocol
has finished.

3.3.1 Encryption algorithms used in the record layer
----------------------------------------------------

Confidentiality in the record layer is achieved by using symmetric block
encryption algorithms like '3DES', 'AES' or stream algorithms like
'ARCFOUR_128'.  Ciphers are encryption algorithms that use a single,
secret, key to encrypt and decrypt data.  Block algorithms in CBC mode
also provide protection against statistical analysis of the data.  Thus,
if you're using the TLS protocol, a random number of blocks will be
appended to data, to prevent eavesdroppers from guessing the actual data
size.

The supported in GnuTLS ciphers and MAC algorithms are shown in *note
Table 3.1: tab:ciphers. and *note Table 3.2: tab:macs.

Algorithm      Description
------------------------------------------------------------------
3DES_CBC       This is the DES block cipher algorithm used with
               triple encryption (EDE). Has 64 bits block size
               and is used in CBC mode.
               
ARCFOUR_128    ARCFOUR_128 is a compatible algorithm with RSA's
               RC4 algorithm, which is considered to be a trade
               secret.  It is a fast cipher but considered weak
               today.
               
AES_CBC        AES or RIJNDAEL is the block cipher algorithm
               that replaces the old DES algorithm.  Has 128
               bits block size and is used in CBC mode.
               
AES_GCM        This is the AES algorithm in the authenticated
               encryption GCM mode.  This mode combines message
               authentication and encryption and can be
               extremely fast on CPUs that support hardware
               acceleration.
               
CAMELLIA_CBC   This is an 128-bit block cipher developed by
               Mitsubishi and NTT. It is one of the approved
               ciphers of the European NESSIE and Japanese
               CRYPTREC projects.
               

Table 3.1: Supported ciphers.

Algorithm      Description
------------------------------------------------------------------
MAC_MD5        This is an HMAC based on MD5 a cryptographic
               hash algorithm designed by Ron Rivest.  Outputs
               128 bits of data.
               
MAC_SHA1       An HMAC based on the SHA1 cryptographic hash
               algorithm designed by NSA. Outputs 160 bits of
               data.
               
MAC_SHA256     An HMAC based on SHA256.  Outputs 256 bits of
               data.
               
MAC_AEAD       This indicates that an authenticated encryption
               algorithm, such as GCM, is in use.

3.3.2 Compression algorithms used in the record layer
-----------------------------------------------------

The TLS record layer also supports compression.  The algorithms
implemented in GnuTLS can be found in the table below.  The included
algorithms perform really good when text, or other compressible data are
to be transferred, but offer nothing on already compressed data, such as
compressed images, zipped archives etc.  These compression algorithms,
may be useful in high bandwidth TLS tunnels, and in cases where network
usage has to be minimized.  It should be noted however that compression
increases latency.

The record layer compression in GnuTLS is implemented based on
[_RFC3749_].  The supported algorithms are shown below.

'GNUTLS_COMP_UNKNOWN'
     Unknown compression method.
'GNUTLS_COMP_NULL'
     The NULL compression method (no compression).
'GNUTLS_COMP_DEFLATE'
     The DEFLATE compression method from zlib.
'GNUTLS_COMP_ZLIB'
     Same as 'GNUTLS_COMP_DEFLATE' .

Figure 3.2: Supported compression algorithms

Note that compression enables attacks such as traffic analysis, or even
plaintext recovery under certain circumstances.  To avoid some of these
attacks GnuTLS allows each record to be compressed independently (i.e.,
stateless compression), by using the "%STATELESS_COMPRESSION" priority
string, in order to be used in cases where the attacker controlled data
are pt in separate records.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Weaknesses and countermeasures,  Next: On Record Padding,  Prev: Compression algorithms used in the record layer,  Up: The TLS record protocol

3.3.3 Weaknesses and countermeasures
------------------------------------

Some weaknesses that may affect the security of the record layer have
been found in TLS 1.0 protocol.  These weaknesses can be exploited by
active attackers, and exploit the facts that

  1. TLS has separate alerts for "decryption_failed" and
     "bad_record_mac"

  2. The decryption failure reason can be detected by timing the
     response time.

  3. The IV for CBC encrypted packets is the last block of the previous
     encrypted packet.

Those weaknesses were solved in TLS 1.1 [_RFC4346_] which is implemented
in GnuTLS.  For this reason we suggest to always negotiate the highest
supported TLS version with the peer(1).  For a detailed discussion of
the issues see the archives of the TLS Working Group mailing list and
[_CBCATT_].

Interoperability::.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: On Record Padding,  Prev: Weaknesses and countermeasures,  Up: The TLS record protocol

3.3.4 On record padding
-----------------------

The TLS protocol allows for extra padding of records in CBC ciphers, to
prevent statistical analysis based on the length of exchanged messages
(see [_RFC5246_] section 6.2.3.2).  GnuTLS appears to be one of few
implementations that take advantage of this feature: the user can
provide some plaintext data with a range of lengths she wishes to hide,
and GnuTLS adds extra padding to make sure the attacker cannot tell the
real plaintext length is in a range smaller than the user-provided one.
Use *note gnutls_record_send_range:: to send length-hidden messages and
*note gnutls_record_can_use_length_hiding:: to check whether the current
session supports length hiding.  Using the standard *note
gnutls_record_send:: will only add minimal padding.

The TLS implementation in the Symbian operating system, frequently used
by Nokia and Sony-Ericsson mobile phones, cannot handle non-minimal
record padding.  What happens when one of these clients handshake with a
GnuTLS server is that the client will fail to compute the correct MAC
for the record.  The client sends a TLS alert ('bad_record_mac') and
disconnects.  Typically this will result in error messages such as 'A
TLS fatal alert has been received', 'Bad record MAC', or both, on the
GnuTLS server side.

If compatibility with such devices is a concern, not sending
length-hidden messages solves the problem by using minimal padding.

If you implement an application that has a configuration file, we
recommend that you make it possible for users or administrators to
specify a GnuTLS protocol priority string, which is used by your
application via *note gnutls_priority_set::.  To allow the best
flexibility, make it possible to have a different priority string for
different incoming IP addresses.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: The TLS Alert Protocol,  Next: The TLS Handshake Protocol,  Prev: The TLS record protocol,  Up: Introduction to TLS

3.4 The TLS alert protocol
==========================

The alert protocol is there to allow signals to be sent between peers.
These signals are mostly used to inform the peer about the cause of a
protocol failure.  Some of these signals are used internally by the
protocol and the application protocol does not have to cope with them
(e.g.  'GNUTLS_A_CLOSE_NOTIFY'), and others refer to the application
protocol solely (e.g.  'GNUTLS_A_USER_CANCELLED').  An alert signal
includes a level indication which may be either fatal or warning.  Fatal
alerts always terminate the current connection, and prevent future
re-negotiations using the current session ID. All alert messages are
summarized in the table below.

The alert messages are protected by the record protocol, thus the
information that is included does not leak.  You must take extreme care
for the alert information not to leak to a possible attacker, via public
log files etc.

3.5 The TLS handshake protocol
==============================

The handshake protocol is responsible for the ciphersuite negotiation,
the initial key exchange, and the authentication of the two peers.  This
is fully controlled by the application layer, thus your program has to
set up the required parameters.  The main handshake function is *note
gnutls_handshake::.  In the next paragraphs we elaborate on the
handshake protocol, i.e., the ciphersuite negotiation.

* Menu:

* TLS Cipher Suites::           TLS session parameters.
* Authentication::              TLS authentication.
* Client Authentication::       Requesting a certificate from the client.
* Resuming Sessions::           Reusing previously established keys.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: TLS Cipher Suites,  Next: Authentication,  Up: The TLS Handshake Protocol

3.5.1 TLS ciphersuites
----------------------

The handshake protocol of TLS negotiates cipher suites of a special form
illustrated by the 'TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_CBC_SHA' cipher suite name.  A
typical cipher suite contains these parameters:

   * The key exchange algorithm.  'DHE_RSA' in the example.

   * The Symmetric encryption algorithm and mode '3DES_CBC' in this
     example.

   * The MAC(1) algorithm used for authentication.  'MAC_SHA' is used in
     the above example.

The cipher suite negotiated in the handshake protocol will affect the
record protocol, by enabling encryption and data authentication.  Note
that you should not over rely on TLS to negotiate the strongest
available cipher suite.  Do not enable ciphers and algorithms that you
consider weak.

All the supported ciphersuites are listed in *note ciphersuites::.

   ---------- Footnotes ----------

   (1) MAC stands for Message Authentication Code.  It can be described
as a keyed hash algorithm.  See RFC2104.

3.5.2 Authentication
--------------------

The key exchange algorithms of the TLS protocol offer authentication,
which is a prerequisite for a secure connection.  The available
authentication methods in GnuTLS follow.

   * Certificate authentication: Authenticated key exchange using public
     key infrastructure and certificates (X.509 or OpenPGP).
   * SRP authentication: Authenticated key exchange using a password.
   * PSK authentication: Authenticated key exchange using a pre-shared
     key.
   * Anonymous authentication: Key exchange without peer authentication.

3.5.3 Client authentication
---------------------------

In the case of ciphersuites that use certificate authentication, the
authentication of the client is optional in TLS.  A server may request a
certificate from the client using the *note
gnutls_certificate_server_set_request:: function.  We elaborate in *note
Certificate credentials::.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Resuming Sessions,  Prev: Client Authentication,  Up: The TLS Handshake Protocol

3.5.4 Resuming sessions
-----------------------

The TLS handshake process performs expensive calculations and a busy
server might easily be put under load.  To reduce the load, session
resumption may be used.  This is a feature of the TLS protocol which
allows a client to connect to a server after a successful handshake,
without the expensive calculations.  This is achieved by re-using the
previously established keys, meaning the server needs to store the state
of established connections (unless session tickets are used - *note
Session tickets::).

Session resumption is an integral part of GnuTLS, and *note Session
resumption::, *note ex-resume-client:: illustrate typical uses of it.

3.6 TLS extensions
==================

A number of extensions to the TLS protocol have been proposed mainly in
[_TLSEXT_]. The extensions supported in GnuTLS are discussed in the
subsections that follow.

* Menu:

* Maximum fragment length negotiation::
* Server name indication::
* Session tickets::
* HeartBeat::
* Safe renegotiation::
* OCSP status request::
* SRTP::
* Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)::


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Maximum fragment length negotiation,  Next: Server name indication,  Up: TLS Extensions

3.6.1 Maximum fragment length negotiation
-----------------------------------------

This extension allows a TLS implementation to negotiate a smaller value
for record packet maximum length.  This extension may be useful to
clients with constrained capabilities.  The functions shown below can be
used to control this extension.

'SIZE_T *note gnutls_record_get_max_size:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION)'
'SSIZE_T *note gnutls_record_set_max_size:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, size_t SIZE)'


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Server name indication,  Next: Session tickets,  Prev: Maximum fragment length negotiation,  Up: TLS Extensions

3.6.2 Server name indication
----------------------------

A common problem in HTTPS servers is the fact that the TLS protocol is
not aware of the hostname that a client connects to, when the handshake
procedure begins.  For that reason the TLS server has no way to know
which certificate to send.

This extension solves that problem within the TLS protocol, and allows a
client to send the HTTP hostname before the handshake begins within the
first handshake packet.  The functions *note gnutls_server_name_set::
and *note gnutls_server_name_get:: can be used to enable this extension,
or to retrieve the name sent by a client.

'INT *note gnutls_server_name_set:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_server_name_type_t TYPE, const void * NAME, size_t NAME_LENGTH)'
'INT *note gnutls_server_name_get:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, void * DATA, size_t * DATA_LENGTH, unsigned int * TYPE, unsigned int INDX)'


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Session tickets,  Next: HeartBeat,  Prev: Server name indication,  Up: TLS Extensions

3.6.3 Session tickets
---------------------

To resume a TLS session, the server normally stores session parameters.
This complicates deployment, and can be avoided by delegating the
storage to the client.  Because session parameters are sensitive they
are encrypted and authenticated with a key only known to the server and
then sent to the client.  The Session Tickets extension is described in
RFC 5077 [_TLSTKT_].

Since version 3.1.3 GnuTLS clients transparently support session
tickets.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: HeartBeat,  Next: Safe renegotiation,  Prev: Session tickets,  Up: TLS Extensions

3.6.4 HeartBeat
---------------

This is a TLS extension that allows to ping and receive confirmation
from the peer, and is described in [_RFC6520_].  The extension is
disabled by default and *note gnutls_heartbeat_enable:: can be used to
enable it.  A policy may be negotiated to only allow sending heartbeat
messages or sending and receiving.  The current session policy can be
checked with *note gnutls_heartbeat_allowed::.  The requests coming from
the peer result to 'GNUTLS_E_HERTBEAT_PING_RECEIVED' being returned from
the receive function.  Ping requests to peer can be send via *note
gnutls_heartbeat_ping::.

'INT *note gnutls_heartbeat_allowed:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, unsigned int TYPE)'
'VOID *note gnutls_heartbeat_enable:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, unsigned int TYPE)'

'INT *note gnutls_heartbeat_ping:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, size_t DATA_SIZE, unsigned int MAX_TRIES, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_heartbeat_pong:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'VOID *note gnutls_heartbeat_set_timeouts:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, unsigned int RETRANS_TIMEOUT, unsigned int TOTAL_TIMEOUT)'
'UNSIGNED INT *note gnutls_heartbeat_get_timeout:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION)'


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Safe renegotiation,  Next: OCSP status request,  Prev: HeartBeat,  Up: TLS Extensions

3.6.5 Safe renegotiation
------------------------

TLS gives the option to two communicating parties to renegotiate and
update their security parameters.  One useful example of this feature
was for a client to initially connect using anonymous negotiation to a
server, and the renegotiate using some authenticated ciphersuite.  This
occurred to avoid having the client sending its credentials in the
clear.

However this renegotiation, as initially designed would not ensure that
the party one is renegotiating is the same as the one in the initial
negotiation.  For example one server could forward all renegotiation
traffic to an other server who will see this traffic as an initial
negotiation attempt.

This might be seen as a valid design decision, but it seems it was not
widely known or understood, thus today some application protocols use
the TLS renegotiation feature in a manner that enables a malicious
server to insert content of his choice in the beginning of a TLS
session.

The most prominent vulnerability was with HTTPS. There servers request a
renegotiation to enforce an anonymous user to use a certificate in order
to access certain parts of a web site.  The attack works by having the
attacker simulate a client and connect to a server, with server-only
authentication, and send some data intended to cause harm.  The server
will then require renegotiation from him in order to perform the
request.  When the proper client attempts to contact the server, the
attacker hijacks that connection and forwards traffic to the initial
server that requested renegotiation.  The attacker will not be able to
read the data exchanged between the client and the server.  However, the
server will (incorrectly) assume that the initial request sent by the
attacker was sent by the now authenticated client.  The result is a
prefix plain-text injection attack.

The above is just one example.  Other vulnerabilities exists that do not
rely on the TLS renegotiation to change the client's authenticated
status (either TLS or application layer).

While fixing these application protocols and implementations would be
one natural reaction, an extension to TLS has been designed that
cryptographically binds together any renegotiated handshakes with the
initial negotiation.  When the extension is used, the attack is detected
and the session can be terminated.  The extension is specified in
[_RFC5746_].

GnuTLS supports the safe renegotiation extension.  The default behavior
is as follows.  Clients will attempt to negotiate the safe renegotiation
extension when talking to servers.  Servers will accept the extension
when presented by clients.  Clients and servers will permit an initial
handshake to complete even when the other side does not support the safe
renegotiation extension.  Clients and servers will refuse renegotiation
attempts when the extension has not been negotiated.

Note that permitting clients to connect to servers when the safe
renegotiation extension is not enabled, is open up for attacks.
Changing this default behavior would prevent interoperability against
the majority of deployed servers out there.  We will reconsider this
default behavior in the future when more servers have been upgraded.
Note that it is easy to configure clients to always require the safe
renegotiation extension from servers.

To modify the default behavior, we have introduced some new priority
strings (see *note Priority Strings::).  The '%UNSAFE_RENEGOTIATION'
priority string permits (re-)handshakes even when the safe renegotiation
extension was not negotiated.  The default behavior is
'%PARTIAL_RENEGOTIATION' that will prevent renegotiation with clients
and servers not supporting the extension.  This is secure for servers
but leaves clients vulnerable to some attacks, but this is a trade-off
between security and compatibility with old servers.  The
'%SAFE_RENEGOTIATION' priority string makes clients and servers require
the extension for every handshake.  The latter is the most secure option
for clients, at the cost of not being able to connect to legacy servers.
Servers will also deny clients that do not support the extension from
connecting.

It is possible to disable use of the extension completely, in both
clients and servers, by using the '%DISABLE_SAFE_RENEGOTIATION' priority
string however we strongly recommend you to only do this for debugging
and test purposes.

The default values if the flags above are not specified are:

'Server:'
     %PARTIAL_RENEGOTIATION

'Client:'
     %PARTIAL_RENEGOTIATION

For applications we have introduced a new API related to safe
renegotiation.  The *note gnutls_safe_renegotiation_status:: function is
used to check if the extension has been negotiated on a session, and can
be used both by clients and servers.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: OCSP status request,  Next: SRTP,  Prev: Safe renegotiation,  Up: TLS Extensions

3.6.6 OCSP status request
-------------------------

The Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is a protocol that allows
the client to verify the server certificate for revocation without
messing with certificate revocation lists.  Its drawback is that it
requires the client to connect to the server's CA OCSP server and
request the status of the certificate.  This extension however, enables
a TLS server to include its CA OCSP server response in the handshake.
That is an HTTPS server may periodically run 'ocsptool' (see *note
ocsptool Invocation::) to obtain its certificate revocation status and
serve it to the clients.  That way a client avoids an additional
connection to the OCSP server.

'VOID *note gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_function:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t SC, gnutls_status_request_ocsp_func OCSP_FUNC, void * PTR)'
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t SC, const char * RESPONSE_FILE, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_ocsp_status_request_enable_client:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_datum_t * RESPONDER_ID, size_t RESPONDER_ID_SIZE, gnutls_datum_t * EXTENSIONS)'
'INT *note gnutls_ocsp_status_request_is_checked:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, unsigned int FLAGS)'

A server is required to provide the OCSP server's response using the
*note gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_file::.  The response
may be obtained periodically using the following command.

     ocsptool --ask --load-cert server_cert.pem --load-issuer the_issuer.pem
              --load-signer the_issuer.pem --outfile ocsp.response

Since version 3.1.3 GnuTLS clients transparently support the certificate
status request.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: SRTP,  Next: Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN),  Prev: OCSP status request,  Up: TLS Extensions

3.6.7 SRTP
----------

The TLS protocol was extended in [_RFC5764_] to provide keying material
to the Secure RTP (SRTP) protocol.  The SRTP protocol provides an
encapsulation of encrypted data that is optimized for voice data.  With
the SRTP TLS extension two peers can negotiate keys using TLS or DTLS
and obtain keying material for use with SRTP. The available SRTP
profiles are listed below.

'GNUTLS_SRTP_AES128_CM_HMAC_SHA1_80'
     128 bit AES with a 80 bit HMAC-SHA1
'GNUTLS_SRTP_AES128_CM_HMAC_SHA1_32'
     128 bit AES with a 32 bit HMAC-SHA1
'GNUTLS_SRTP_NULL_HMAC_SHA1_80'
     NULL cipher with a 80 bit HMAC-SHA1
'GNUTLS_SRTP_NULL_HMAC_SHA1_32'
     NULL cipher with a 32 bit HMAC-SHA1

Figure 3.3: Supported SRTP profiles

To enable use the following functions.

'INT *note gnutls_srtp_set_profile:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_srtp_profile_t PROFILE)'
'INT *note gnutls_srtp_set_profile_direct:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, const char * PROFILES, const char ** ERR_POS)'

To obtain the negotiated keys use the function below.

 -- Function: int gnutls_srtp_get_keys (gnutls_session_t SESSION, void *
          KEY_MATERIAL, unsigned int KEY_MATERIAL_SIZE, gnutls_datum_t *
          CLIENT_KEY, gnutls_datum_t * CLIENT_SALT, gnutls_datum_t *
          SERVER_KEY, gnutls_datum_t * SERVER_SALT)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' structure.

     KEY_MATERIAL: Space to hold the generated key material

     KEY_MATERIAL_SIZE: The maximum size of the key material

     CLIENT_KEY: The master client write key, pointing inside the key
     material

     CLIENT_SALT: The master client write salt, pointing inside the key
     material

     SERVER_KEY: The master server write key, pointing inside the key
     material

     SERVER_SALT: The master server write salt, pointing inside the key
     material

     This is a helper function to generate the keying material for SRTP.
     It requires the space of the key material to be pre-allocated
     (should be at least 2x the maximum key size and salt size).  The
     'client_key' , 'client_salt' , 'server_key' and 'server_salt' are
     convenience datums that point inside the key material.  They may be
     'NULL' .

     *Returns:* On success the size of the key material is returned,
     otherwise, 'GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER' if the buffer given is
     not sufficient, or a negative error code.

     Since 3.1.4

Other helper functions are listed below.

'INT *note gnutls_srtp_get_selected_profile:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_srtp_profile_t * PROFILE)'
'CONST CHAR * *note gnutls_srtp_get_profile_name:: (gnutls_srtp_profile_t PROFILE)'
'INT *note gnutls_srtp_get_profile_id:: (const char * NAME, gnutls_srtp_profile_t * PROFILE)'

3.6.8 Application Layer Protocol Negotiation (ALPN)
---------------------------------------------------

The TLS protocol was extended in 'draft-ietf-tls-applayerprotoneg-00' to
provide the application layer a method of negotiating the application
protocol version.  This allows for negotiation of the application
protocol during the TLS handshake, thus reducing round-trips.  The
application protocol is described by an opaque string.  To enable, use
the following functions.

'INT *note gnutls_alpn_set_protocols:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, const gnutls_datum_t * PROTOCOLS, unsigned PROTOCOLS_SIZE, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_alpn_get_selected_protocol:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_datum_t * PROTOCOL)'

Note that these functions are intended to be used with protocols that
are registered in the Application Layer Protocol Negotiation IANA
registry.  While you can use them for other protocols (at the risk of
collisions), it is preferable to register them.

3.7 How to use TLS in application protocols
===========================================

This chapter is intended to provide some hints on how to use the TLS
over simple custom made application protocols.  The discussion below
mainly refers to the TCP/IP transport layer but may be extended to other
ones too.

* Menu:

* Separate ports::
* Upward negotiation::


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Separate ports,  Next: Upward negotiation,  Up: How to use TLS in application protocols

3.7.1 Separate ports
--------------------

Traditionally SSL was used in application protocols by assigning a new
port number for the secure services.  That way two separate ports were
assigned, one for the non secure sessions, and one for the secured ones.
This has the benefit that if a user requests a secure session then the
client will try to connect to the secure port and fail otherwise.  The
only possible attack with this method is a denial of service one.  The
most famous example of this method is the famous "HTTP over TLS" or
HTTPS protocol [_RFC2818_].

Despite its wide use, this method is not as good as it seems.  This
approach starts the TLS Handshake procedure just after the client
connects on the --so called-- secure port.  That way the TLS protocol
does not know anything about the client, and popular methods like the
host advertising in HTTP do not work(1).  There is no way for the client
to say "I connected to YYY server" before the Handshake starts, so the
server cannot possibly know which certificate to use.

Other than that it requires two separate ports to run a single service,
which is unnecessary complication.  Due to the fact that there is a
limitation on the available privileged ports, this approach was soon
obsoleted.

serverind::.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Upward negotiation,  Prev: Separate ports,  Up: How to use TLS in application protocols

3.7.2 Upward negotiation
------------------------

Other application protocols(1) use a different approach to enable the
secure layer.  They use something often called as the "TLS upgrade"
method.  This method is quite tricky but it is more flexible.  The idea
is to extend the application protocol to have a "STARTTLS" request,
whose purpose it to start the TLS protocols just after the client
requests it.  This approach does not require any extra port to be
reserved.  There is even an extension to HTTP protocol to support that
method [_RFC2817_].

The tricky part, in this method, is that the "STARTTLS" request is sent
in the clear, thus is vulnerable to modifications.  A typical attack is
to modify the messages in a way that the client is fooled and thinks
that the server does not have the "STARTTLS" capability.  See a typical
conversation of a hypothetical protocol:

     (client connects to the server)

     CLIENT: HELLO I'M MR. XXX

     SERVER: NICE TO MEET YOU XXX

     CLIENT: PLEASE START TLS

     SERVER: OK

     *** TLS STARTS

     CLIENT: HERE ARE SOME CONFIDENTIAL DATA

And see an example of a conversation where someone is acting in between:

     (client connects to the server)

     CLIENT: HELLO I'M MR. XXX

     SERVER: NICE TO MEET YOU XXX

     CLIENT: PLEASE START TLS

     (here someone inserts this message)

     SERVER: SORRY I DON'T HAVE THIS CAPABILITY

     CLIENT: HERE ARE SOME CONFIDENTIAL DATA

As you can see above the client was fooled, and was dummy enough to send
the confidential data in the clear.

How to avoid the above attack?  As you may have already noticed this one
is easy to avoid.  The client has to ask the user before it connects
whether the user requests TLS or not.  If the user answered that he
certainly wants the secure layer the last conversation should be:

     (client connects to the server)

     CLIENT: HELLO I'M MR. XXX

     SERVER: NICE TO MEET YOU XXX

     CLIENT: PLEASE START TLS

     (here someone inserts this message)

     SERVER: SORRY I DON'T HAVE THIS CAPABILITY

     CLIENT: BYE

     (the client notifies the user that the secure connection was not
     possible)

This method, if implemented properly, is far better than the traditional
method, and the security properties remain the same, since only denial
of service is possible.  The benefit is that the server may request
additional data before the TLS Handshake protocol starts, in order to
send the correct certificate, use the correct password file, or anything
else!

3.8 On SSL 2 and older protocols
================================

One of the initial decisions in the GnuTLS development was to implement
the known security protocols for the transport layer.  Initially TLS 1.0
was implemented since it was the latest at that time, and was considered
to be the most advanced in security properties.  Later the SSL 3.0
protocol was implemented since it is still the only protocol supported
by several servers and there are no serious security vulnerabilities
known.

One question that may arise is why we didn't implement SSL 2.0 in the
library.  There are several reasons, most important being that it has
serious security flaws, unacceptable for a modern security library.
Other than that, this protocol is barely used by anyone these days since
it has been deprecated since 1996.  The security problems in SSL 2.0
include:

   * Message integrity compromised.  The SSLv2 message authentication
     uses the MD5 function, and is insecure.

   * Man-in-the-middle attack.  There is no protection of the handshake
     in SSLv2, which permits a man-in-the-middle attack.

   * Truncation attack.  SSLv2 relies on TCP FIN to close the session,
     so the attacker can forge a TCP FIN, and the peer cannot tell if it
     was a legitimate end of data or not.

   * Weak message integrity for export ciphers.  The cryptographic keys
     in SSLv2 are used for both message authentication and encryption,
     so if weak encryption schemes are negotiated (say 40-bit keys) the
     message authentication code uses the same weak key, which isn't
     necessary.

Other protocols such as Microsoft's PCT 1 and PCT 2 were not implemented
because they were also abandoned and deprecated by SSL 3.0 and later TLS
1.0.

4 Authentication methods
************************

The initial key exchange of the TLS protocol performs authentication of
the peers.  In typical scenarios the server is authenticated to the
client, and optionally the client to the server.

While many associate TLS with X.509 certificates and public key
authentication, the protocol supports various authentication methods,
including pre-shared keys, and passwords.  In this chapter a description
of the existing authentication methods is provided, as well as some
guidance on which use-cases each method can be used at.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Certificate authentication,  Next: More on certificate authentication,  Up: Authentication methods

4.1 Certificate authentication
==============================

The most known authentication method of TLS are certificates.  The PKIX
[_PKIX_] public key infrastructure is daily used by anyone using a
browser today.  GnuTLS supports both X.509 certificates [_PKIX_] and
OpenPGP certificates using a common API.

The key exchange algorithms supported by certificate authentication are
shown in *note Table 4.1: tab:key-exchange.

Key exchange   Description
               
------------------------------------------------------------------
RSA            The RSA algorithm is used to encrypt a key and
               send it to the peer.  The certificate must allow
               the key to be used for encryption.
               
DHE_RSA        The RSA algorithm is used to sign ephemeral
               Diffie-Hellman parameters which are sent to the
               peer.  The key in the certificate must allow the
               key to be used for signing.  Note that key
               exchange algorithms which use ephemeral
               Diffie-Hellman parameters, offer perfect forward
               secrecy.  That means that even if the private
               key used for signing is compromised, it cannot
               be used to reveal past session data.
               
ECDHE_RSA      The RSA algorithm is used to sign ephemeral
               elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman parameters which
               are sent to the peer.  The key in the
               certificate must allow the key to be used for
               signing.  It also offers perfect forward
               secrecy.  That means that even if the private
               key used for signing is compromised, it cannot
               be used to reveal past session data.
               
DHE_DSS        The DSA algorithm is used to sign ephemeral
               Diffie-Hellman parameters which are sent to the

4.1.1 X.509 certificates
------------------------

The X.509 protocols rely on a hierarchical trust model.  In this trust
model Certification Authorities (CAs) are used to certify entities.
Usually more than one certification authorities exist, and certification
authorities may certify other authorities to issue certificates as well,
following a hierarchical model.

 [image src="gnutls-x509.png" ]

Figure 4.1: An example of the X.509 hierarchical trust model.

One needs to trust one or more CAs for his secure communications.  In
that case only the certificates issued by the trusted authorities are
acceptable.  The framework is illustrated on *note Figure 4.1: fig-x509.

4.1.1.1 X.509 certificate structure
...................................

An X.509 certificate usually contains information about the certificate
holder, the signer, a unique serial number, expiration dates and some
other fields [_PKIX_] as shown in *note Table 4.2: tab:x509.

Field          Description
               
------------------------------------------------------------------
version        The field that indicates the version of the
               certificate.
               
serialNumber   This field holds a unique serial number per
               certificate.
               
signature      The issuing authority's signature.
               
issuer         Holds the issuer's distinguished name.
               
validity       The activation and expiration dates.
               
subject        The subject's distinguished name of the
               certificate.
               
extensions     The extensions are fields only present in
               version 3 certificates.
               

Table 4.2: X.509 certificate fields.

The certificate's _subject or issuer name_ is not just a single string.
It is a Distinguished name and in the ASN.1 notation is a sequence of
several object identifiers with their corresponding values.  Some of
available OIDs to be used in an X.509 distinguished name are defined in
'gnutls/x509.h'.

The _Version_ field in a certificate has values either 1 or 3 for
version 3 certificates.  Version 1 certificates do not support the
extensions field so it is not possible to distinguish a CA from a
person, thus their usage should be avoided.

The _validity_ dates are there to indicate the date that the specific
certificate was activated and the date the certificate's key would be
considered invalid.

In GnuTLS the X.509 certificate structures are handled using the
'gnutls_x509_crt_t' type and the corresponding private keys with the
'gnutls_x509_privkey_t' type.  All the available functions for X.509
certificate handling have their prototypes in 'gnutls/x509.h'.  An
example program to demonstrate the X.509 parsing capabilities can be
found in *note ex-x509-info::.

4.1.1.2 Importing an X.509 certificate
......................................

The certificate structure should be initialized using *note
gnutls_x509_crt_init::, and a certificate structure can be imported
using *note gnutls_x509_crt_import::.

'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_init:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t * CERT)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_import:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT)'
'VOID *note gnutls_x509_crt_deinit:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT)'

In several functions an array of certificates is required.  To assist in
initialization and import the following two functions are provided.

'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_list_import:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t * CERTS, unsigned int * CERT_MAX, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_list_import2:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t ** CERTS, unsigned int * SIZE, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, unsigned int FLAGS)'

In all cases after use a certificate must be deinitialized using *note
gnutls_x509_crt_deinit::.  Note that although the functions above apply
to 'gnutls_x509_crt_t' structure, similar functions exist for the CRL
structure 'gnutls_x509_crl_t'.

4.1.1.3 X.509 distinguished names
.................................

The "subject" of an X.509 certificate is not described by a single name,
but rather with a distinguished name.  This in X.509 terminology is a
list of strings each associated an object identifier.  To make things
simple GnuTLS provides *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn2:: which follows the
rules in [_RFC4514_] and returns a single string.  Access to each string
by individual object identifiers can be accessed using *note
gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn_by_oid::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn2 (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT,
          gnutls_datum_t * DN)
     CERT: should contain a 'gnutls_x509_crt_t' structure

     DN: a pointer to a structure to hold the name

     This function will allocate buffer and copy the name of the
     Certificate.  The name will be in the form "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz"
     as described in RFC4514.  The output string will be ASCII or UTF-8
     encoded, depending on the certificate data.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.  and a negative error code on
     error.

     *Since:* 3.1.10
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, char * BUF, size_t * BUF_SIZE)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn_by_oid:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, const char * OID, int INDX, unsigned int RAW_FLAG, void * BUF, size_t * BUF_SIZE)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_dn_oid:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, int INDX, void * OID, size_t * OID_SIZE)'

Similar functions exist to access the distinguished name of the issuer
of the certificate.

'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, char * BUF, size_t * BUF_SIZE)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn2:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, gnutls_datum_t * DN)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn_by_oid:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, const char * OID, int INDX, unsigned int RAW_FLAG, void * BUF, size_t * BUF_SIZE)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn_oid:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, int INDX, void * OID, size_t * OID_SIZE)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, gnutls_x509_dn_t * DN)'

The more powerful *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject:: and *note
gnutls_x509_dn_get_rdn_ava:: provide efficient but low-level access to
the contents of the distinguished name structure.

'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, gnutls_x509_dn_t * DN)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, gnutls_x509_dn_t * DN)'

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_dn_get_rdn_ava (gnutls_x509_dn_t DN, int
          IRDN, int IAVA, gnutls_x509_ava_st * AVA)
     DN: a pointer to DN

     IRDN: index of RDN

     IAVA: index of AVA.

     AVA: Pointer to structure which will hold output information.

     Get pointers to data within the DN. The format of the 'ava'
     structure is shown below.

     struct gnutls_x509_ava_st { gnutls_datum_t oid; gnutls_datum_t
     value; unsigned long value_tag; };

     The X.509 distinguished name is a sequence of sequences of strings
     and this is what the 'irdn' and 'iava' indexes model.

     Note that 'ava' will contain pointers into the 'dn' structure which
     in turns points to the original certificate.  Thus you should not
     modify any data or deallocate any of those.

     This is a low-level function that requires the caller to do the
     value conversions when necessary (e.g.  from UCS-2).

     *Returns:* Returns 0 on success, or an error code.

4.1.1.4 X.509 extensions
........................

X.509 version 3 certificates include a list of extensions that can be
used to obtain additional information on the subject or the issuer of
the certificate.  Those may be e-mail addresses, flags that indicate
whether the belongs to a CA etc.  All the supported X.509 version 3
extensions are shown in *note Table 4.3: tab:x509-ext.

The certificate extensions access is split into two parts.  The first
requires to retrieve the extension, and the second is the parsing part.

To enumerate and retrieve the DER-encoded extension data available in a
certificate the following two functions are available.
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_info:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, int INDX, void * OID, size_t * OID_SIZE, unsigned int * CRITICAL)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_data2:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, unsigned INDX, gnutls_datum_t * DATA)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_by_oid2:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, const char * OID, int INDX, gnutls_datum_t * OUTPUT, unsigned int * CRITICAL)'

After a supported DER-encoded extension is retrieved it can be parsed
using the APIs in 'x509-ext.h'.  Complex extensions may require
initializing an intermediate structure that holds the parsed extension
data.  Examples of simple parsing functions are shown below.
'INT *note gnutls_x509_ext_import_basic_constraints:: (const gnutls_datum_t * EXT, unsigned int * CA, int * PATHLEN)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_ext_export_basic_constraints:: (unsigned int CA, int PATHLEN, gnutls_datum_t * EXT)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_ext_import_key_usage:: (const gnutls_datum_t * EXT, unsigned int * KEY_USAGE)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_ext_export_key_usage:: (unsigned int USAGE, gnutls_datum_t * EXT)'

More complex extensions, such as Name Constraints, require an
intermediate structure, in that case 'gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t' to
be initialized in order to store the parsed extension data.
'INT *note gnutls_x509_ext_import_name_constraints:: (const gnutls_datum_t * EXT, gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t NC, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_ext_export_name_constraints:: (gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t NC, gnutls_datum_t * EXT)'

After the name constraints are extracted in the structure, the following
functions can be used to access them.

'INT *note gnutls_x509_name_constraints_get_permitted:: (gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t NC, unsigned IDX, unsigned * TYPE, gnutls_datum_t * NAME)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_name_constraints_get_excluded:: (gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t NC, unsigned IDX, unsigned * TYPE, gnutls_datum_t * NAME)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_name_constraints_add_permitted:: (gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t NC, gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t TYPE, const gnutls_datum_t * NAME)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_name_constraints_add_excluded:: (gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t NC, gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t TYPE, const gnutls_datum_t * NAME)'
'UNSIGNED *note gnutls_x509_name_constraints_check:: (gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t NC, gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t TYPE, const gnutls_datum_t * NAME)'
'UNSIGNED *note gnutls_x509_name_constraints_check_crt:: (gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t NC, gnutls_x509_subject_alt_name_t TYPE, gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT)'

Other utility functions are listed below.
'INT *note gnutls_x509_name_constraints_init:: (gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t * NC)'
'VOID *note gnutls_x509_name_constraints_deinit:: (gnutls_x509_name_constraints_t NC)'

Similar functions exist for all of the other supported extensions,
listed in *note Table 4.3: tab:x509-ext.

4.1.1.5 Accessing public and private keys
.........................................

Each X.509 certificate contains a public key that corresponds to a
private key.  To get a unique identifier of the public key the *note
gnutls_x509_crt_get_key_id:: function is provided.  To export the public
key or its parameters you may need to convert the X.509 structure to a
'gnutls_pubkey_t'.  See *note Abstract public keys:: for more
information.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crt_get_key_id (gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT,
          unsigned int FLAGS, unsigned char * OUTPUT_DATA, size_t *
          OUTPUT_DATA_SIZE)
     CRT: Holds the certificate

     FLAGS: should be 0 for now

     OUTPUT_DATA: will contain the key ID

     OUTPUT_DATA_SIZE: holds the size of output_data (and will be
     replaced by the actual size of parameters)

     This function will return a unique ID that depends on the public
     key parameters.  This ID can be used in checking whether a
     certificate corresponds to the given private key.

     If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then
     *output_data_size is updated and GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will
     be returned.  The output will normally be a SHA-1 hash output,
     which is 20 bytes.

     *Returns:* In case of failure a negative error code will be
     returned, and 0 on success.

The private key parameters may be directly accessed by using one of the

4.1.1.6 Verifying X.509 certificate paths
.........................................

Verifying certificate paths is important in X.509 authentication.  For
this purpose the following functions are provided.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_cas
          (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t LIST, const gnutls_x509_crt_t *
          CLIST, unsigned CLIST_SIZE, unsigned int FLAGS)
     LIST: The structure of the list

     CLIST: A list of CAs

     CLIST_SIZE: The length of the CA list

     FLAGS: should be 0 or an or'ed sequence of 'GNUTLS_TL' options.

     This function will add the given certificate authorities to the
     trusted list.  The list of CAs must not be deinitialized during
     this structure's lifetime.

     If the flag 'GNUTLS_TL_NO_DUPLICATES' is specified, then the
     provided 'clist' entries that are duplicates will not be added to
     the list and will be deinitialized.

     *Returns:* The number of added elements is returned.

     *Since:* 3.0.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt
          (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t LIST, gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, const
          void * NAME, size_t NAME_SIZE, unsigned int FLAGS)
     LIST: The structure of the list

     CERT: A certificate

     NAME: An identifier for the certificate

     NAME_SIZE: The size of the identifier

     FLAGS: should be 0.

     This function will add the given certificate to the trusted list
     and associate it with a name.  The certificate will not be be used
     for verification with 'gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt()' but
     only with 'gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_named_crt()' .

     In principle this function can be used to set individual "server"
     certificates that are trusted by the user for that specific server
     but for no other purposes.

     The certificate must not be deinitialized during the lifetime of
     the trusted list.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.0.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_crls
          (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t LIST, const gnutls_x509_crl_t *
          CRL_LIST, int CRL_SIZE, unsigned int FLAGS, unsigned int
          VERIFICATION_FLAGS)
     LIST: The structure of the list

     CRL_LIST: A list of CRLs

     CRL_SIZE: The length of the CRL list

     FLAGS: if GNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL is given the CRLs will be verified
     before being added.

     VERIFICATION_FLAGS: gnutls_certificate_verify_flags if flags
     specifies GNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL

     This function will add the given certificate revocation lists to
     the trusted list.  The list of CRLs must not be deinitialized
     during this structure's lifetime.

     This function must be called after
     'gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_cas()' to allow verifying the CRLs for
     validity.

     *Returns:* The number of added elements is returned.

     *Since:* 3.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt
          (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t LIST, gnutls_x509_crt_t * CERT_LIST,
          unsigned int CERT_LIST_SIZE, unsigned int FLAGS, unsigned int
          * VOUTPUT, gnutls_verify_output_function FUNC)
     LIST: The structure of the list

     CERT_LIST: is the certificate list to be verified

     CERT_LIST_SIZE: is the certificate list size

     FLAGS: Flags that may be used to change the verification algorithm.
     Use OR of the gnutls_certificate_verify_flags enumerations.

     VOUTPUT: will hold the certificate verification output.

     FUNC: If non-null will be called on each chain element verification
     with the output.

     This function will try to verify the given certificate and return
     its status.  The 'verify' parameter will hold an OR'ed sequence of
     'gnutls_certificate_status_t' flags.

     Additionally a certificate verification profile can be specified
     from the ones in 'gnutls_certificate_verification_profiles_t' by
     ORing the result of 'GNUTLS_PROFILE_TO_VFLAGS()' to the
     verification flags.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt2
          (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t LIST, gnutls_x509_crt_t * CERT_LIST,
          unsigned int CERT_LIST_SIZE, gnutls_typed_vdata_st * DATA,
          unsigned int ELEMENTS, unsigned int FLAGS, unsigned int *
          VOUTPUT, gnutls_verify_output_function FUNC)
     LIST: The structure of the list

     CERT_LIST: is the certificate list to be verified

     CERT_LIST_SIZE: is the certificate list size

     DATA: an array of typed data

     ELEMENTS: the number of data elements

     FLAGS: Flags that may be used to change the verification algorithm.
     Use OR of the gnutls_certificate_verify_flags enumerations.

     VOUTPUT: will hold the certificate verification output.

     FUNC: If non-null will be called on each chain element verification
     with the output.

     This function will try to verify the given certificate and return
     its status.  The 'verify' parameter will hold an OR'ed sequence of
     'gnutls_certificate_status_t' flags.

     Additionally a certificate verification profile can be specified
     from the ones in 'gnutls_certificate_verification_profiles_t' by
     ORing the result of 'GNUTLS_PROFILE_TO_VFLAGS()' to the
     verification flags.

     The acceptable 'data' types are 'GNUTLS_DT_DNS_HOSTNAME' and
     'GNUTLS_DT_KEY_PURPOSE_OID' .  The former accepts as data a
     null-terminated hostname, and the latter a null-terminated object
     identifier (e.g., 'GNUTLS_KP_TLS_WWW_SERVER' ).  If a DNS hostname
     is provided then this function will compare the hostname in the
     certificate against the given.  If names do not match the
     'GNUTLS_CERT_UNEXPECTED_OWNER' status flag will be set.  If a key
     purpose OID is provided and the end-certificate contains the
     extended key usage PKIX extension, it will be required to be have
     the provided key purpose or be marked for any purpose, otherwise
     verification will fail with
     'GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNER_CONSTRAINTS_FAILURE' status.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.  Note that verification failure
     will not result to an error code, only 'voutput' will be updated.

     *Since:* 3.3.8

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_named_crt
          (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t LIST, gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT, const
          void * NAME, size_t NAME_SIZE, unsigned int FLAGS, unsigned
          int * VOUTPUT, gnutls_verify_output_function FUNC)
     LIST: The structure of the list

     CERT: is the certificate to be verified

     NAME: is the certificate's name

     NAME_SIZE: is the certificate's name size

     FLAGS: Flags that may be used to change the verification algorithm.
     Use OR of the gnutls_certificate_verify_flags enumerations.

     VOUTPUT: will hold the certificate verification output.

     FUNC: If non-null will be called on each chain element verification
     with the output.

     This function will try to find a certificate that is associated
     with the provided name -see
     'gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt()' .  If a match is found the
     certificate is considered valid.  In addition to that this function
     will also check CRLs.  The 'voutput' parameter will hold an OR'ed
     sequence of 'gnutls_certificate_status_t' flags.

     Additionally a certificate verification profile can be specified
     from the ones in 'gnutls_certificate_verification_profiles_t' by
     ORing the result of 'GNUTLS_PROFILE_TO_VFLAGS()' to the
     verification flags.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.0.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_trust_file
          (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t LIST, const char * CA_FILE, const
          char * CRL_FILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE, unsigned int
          TL_FLAGS, unsigned int TL_VFLAGS)
     LIST: The structure of the list

     CA_FILE: A file containing a list of CAs (optional)

     CRL_FILE: A file containing a list of CRLs (optional)

     TYPE: The format of the certificates

     TL_FLAGS: GNUTLS_TL_*

     TL_VFLAGS: gnutls_certificate_verify_flags if flags specifies
     GNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL

     This function will add the given certificate authorities to the
     trusted list.  PKCS '11' URLs are also accepted, instead of files,
     by this function.  A PKCS '11' URL implies a trust database (a
     specially marked module in p11-kit); the URL "pkcs11:" implies all
     trust databases in the system.  Only a single URL specifying trust
     databases can be set; they cannot be stacked with multiple calls.

     *Returns:* The number of added elements is returned.

     *Since:* 3.1

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_trust_mem
          (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t LIST, const gnutls_datum_t * CAS,
          const gnutls_datum_t * CRLS, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE,

     TL_VFLAGS: gnutls_certificate_verify_flags if flags specifies
     GNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL

     This function will add the given certificate authorities to the
     trusted list.

     *Returns:* The number of added elements is returned.

     *Since:* 3.1

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_system_trust
          (gnutls_x509_trust_list_t LIST, unsigned int TL_FLAGS,
          unsigned int TL_VFLAGS)
     LIST: The structure of the list

     TL_FLAGS: GNUTLS_TL_*

     TL_VFLAGS: gnutls_certificate_verify_flags if flags specifies
     GNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL

     This function adds the system's default trusted certificate
     authorities to the trusted list.  Note that on unsupported systems
     this function returns 'GNUTLS_E_UNIMPLEMENTED_FEATURE' .

     This function implies the flag 'GNUTLS_TL_NO_DUPLICATES' .

     *Returns:* The number of added elements or a negative error code on
     error.

     *Since:* 3.1

The verification function will verify a given certificate chain against
a list of certificate authorities and certificate revocation lists, and
output a bit-wise OR of elements of the 'gnutls_certificate_status_t'
enumeration shown in *note Figure 4.2: gnutls_certificate_status_t.  The
'GNUTLS_CERT_INVALID' flag is always set on a verification error and
more detailed flags will also be set when appropriate.

'GNUTLS_CERT_INVALID'
     The certificate is not signed by one of the known authorities or
     the signature is invalid (deprecated by the flags
     'GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNATURE_FAILURE' and 'GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNER_NOT_FOUND'
     ).
'GNUTLS_CERT_REVOKED'
     Certificate is revoked by its authority.  In X.509 this will be set
     only if CRLs are checked.
'GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNER_NOT_FOUND'
     The certificate's issuer is not known.  This is the case if the
     issuer is not included in the trusted certificate list.
'GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNER_NOT_CA'
     The certificate's signer was not a CA. This may happen if this was
     a version 1 certificate, which is common with some CAs, or a
     version 3 certificate without the basic constrains extension.
'GNUTLS_CERT_INSECURE_ALGORITHM'
     The certificate was signed using an insecure algorithm such as MD2
     or MD5.  These algorithms have been broken and should not be
     trusted.
'GNUTLS_CERT_NOT_ACTIVATED'
     The certificate is not yet activated.
'GNUTLS_CERT_EXPIRED'
     The certificate has expired.
'GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNATURE_FAILURE'
     The signature verification failed.
'GNUTLS_CERT_REVOCATION_DATA_SUPERSEDED'
     The revocation data are old and have been superseded.
'GNUTLS_CERT_UNEXPECTED_OWNER'
     The owner is not the expected one.
'GNUTLS_CERT_REVOCATION_DATA_ISSUED_IN_FUTURE'
     The revocation data have a future issue date.
'GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNER_CONSTRAINTS_FAILURE'
     The certificate's signer constraints were violated.
'GNUTLS_CERT_MISMATCH'
     The certificate presented isn't the expected one (TOFU)

Figure 4.2: The 'gnutls_certificate_status_t' enumeration.

An example of certificate verification is shown in *note ex-verify2::.
It is also possible to have a set of certificates that are trusted for a
particular server but not to authorize other certificates.  This purpose
is served by the functions *note gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt::
and *note gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_named_crt::.

4.1.1.7 Verifying a certificate in the context of TLS session
.............................................................

When operating in the context of a TLS session, the trusted certificate
authority list may also be set using:
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, const char * CAFILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE)'
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_dir:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, const char * CA_DIR, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE)'
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_crl_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const char * CRLFILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE)'
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_system_trust:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED)'

These functions allow the specification of the trusted certificate
authorities, either via a file, a directory or use the system-specified
certificate authories.  Unless the authorities are application specific,
it is generally recommended to use the system trust storage (see *note
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_system_trust::).

Unlike the previous section it is not required to setup a trusted list,
and the function *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3:: is used to
verify the peer's certificate chain and identity.  The reported
verification status is identical to the verification functions described
in the previous section.  Note that in certain cases it is required to
check the marked purpose of the end certificate (e.g.
'GNUTLS_KP_TLS_WWW_SERVER'); in these cases the more advanced *note
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers:: should be used instead.

There is also the possibility to pass some input to the verification
functions in the form of flags.  For *note
gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt2:: the flags are passed directly, but
for *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3::, the flags are set using
*note gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags::.  All the available flags
are part of the enumeration 'gnutls_certificate_verify_flags' shown in
*note Figure 4.3: gnutls_certificate_verify_flags.

'GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_CA_SIGN'
     If set a signer does not have to be a certificate authority.  This
     flag should normally be disabled, unless you know what this means.
'GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_SAME'
     If a certificate is not signed by anyone trusted but exists in the
     trusted CA list do not treat it as trusted.
'GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_ANY_X509_V1_CA_CRT'
     Allow CA certificates that have version 1 (both root and
     intermediate).  This might be dangerous since those haven't the
     basicConstraints extension.
'GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD2'
     Allow certificates to be signed using the broken MD2 algorithm.
'GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5'
     Allow certificates to be signed using the broken MD5 algorithm.
'GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_TIME_CHECKS'
     Disable checking of activation and expiration validity periods of
     certificate chains.  Don't set this unless you understand the
     security implications.
'GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_TRUSTED_TIME_CHECKS'
     If set a signer in the trusted list is never checked for expiration
     or activation.
'GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_X509_V1_CA_CRT'
     Do not allow trusted CA certificates that have version 1.  This
     option is to be used to deprecate all certificates of version 1.
'GNUTLS_VERIFY_DISABLE_CRL_CHECKS'
     Disable checking for validity using certificate revocation lists or
     the available OCSP data.
'GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_UNSORTED_CHAIN'
     A certificate chain is tolerated if unsorted (the case with many
     TLS servers out there).  This is the default since GnuTLS 3.1.4.
'GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_UNSORTED_CHAIN'
     Do not tolerate an unsorted certificate chain.
'GNUTLS_VERIFY_DO_NOT_ALLOW_WILDCARDS'
     When including a hostname check in the verification, do not
     consider any wildcards.

4.1.1.8 Verifying a certificate using PKCS #11
..............................................

Some systems provide a system wide trusted certificate storage
accessible using the PKCS #11 API. That is, the trusted certificates are
queried and accessed using the PKCS #11 API, and trusted certificate
properties, such as purpose, are marked using attached extensions.  One
example is the p11-kit trust module(1).

These special PKCS #11 modules can be used for GnuTLS certificate
verification if marked as trust policy modules, i.e., with
'trust-policy: yes' in the p11-kit module file.  The way to use them is
by specifying to the file verification function (e.g., *note
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file::), a pkcs11 URL, or simply
'pkcs11:' to use all the marked with trust policy modules.

The trust modules of p11-kit assign a purpose to trusted authorities
using the extended key usage object identifiers.  The common purposes
are shown in *note Table 4.4: tab:purposes.  Note that typically
according to [_RFC5280_] the extended key usage object identifiers apply
to end certificates.  Their application to CA certificates is an
extension used by the trust modules.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
GNUTLS_KP_TLS_WWW_SERVER1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1The certificate is to be used for TLS WWW
                              authentication.  When in a CA
                              certificate, it indicates that the CA is
                              allowed to sign certificates for TLS WWW
                              authentication.
                              
GNUTLS_KP_TLS_WWW_CLIENT1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2The certificate is to be used for TLS WWW
                              client authentication.  When in a CA
                              certificate, it indicates that the CA is
                              allowed to sign certificates for TLS WWW
                              client authentication.
                              
GNUTLS_KP_CODE_SIGNING1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3The certificate is to be used for code
                              signing.  When in a CA certificate, it
                              indicates that the CA is allowed to sign
                              certificates for code signing.
                              
GNUTLS_KP_EMAIL_PROTECTION1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.4The certificate is to be used for email
                              protection.  When in a CA certificate, it
                              indicates that the CA is allowed to sign
                              certificates for email users.
                              
GNUTLS_KP_OCSP_SIGNING1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.9The certificate is to be used for signing
                              OCSP responses.  When in a CA
                              certificate, it indicates that the CA is
                              allowed to sign certificates which sign
                              OCSP reponses.
                              
GNUTLS_KP_ANY  2.5.29.37.0    The certificate is to be used for any
                              purpose.  When in a CA certificate, it
                              indicates that the CA is allowed to sign
                              any kind of certificates.
                              

Table 4.4: Key purpose object identifiers.

With such modules, it is recommended to use the verification functions
*note gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt2::, or *note
gnutls_certificate_verify_peers::, which allow to explicitly specify the
key purpose.  The other verification functions which do not allow
setting a purpose, would operate as if 'GNUTLS_KP_TLS_WWW_SERVER' was
requested from the trusted authorities.

4.1.2 OpenPGP certificates
--------------------------

The OpenPGP key authentication relies on a distributed trust model,
called the "web of trust".  The "web of trust" uses a decentralized
system of trusted introducers, which are the same as a CA. OpenPGP
allows anyone to sign anyone else's public key.  When Alice signs Bob's
key, she is introducing Bob's key to anyone who trusts Alice.  If
someone trusts Alice to introduce keys, then Alice is a trusted
introducer in the mind of that observer.  For example in *note Figure
4.4: fig-openpgp, David trusts Alice to be an introducer and Alice
signed Bob's key thus Dave trusts Bob's key to be the real one.

 [image src="gnutls-pgp.png" ]

Figure 4.4: An example of the OpenPGP trust model.

There are some key points that are important in that model.  In the
example Alice has to sign Bob's key, only if she is sure that the key
belongs to Bob.  Otherwise she may also make Dave falsely believe that
this is Bob's key.  Dave has also the responsibility to know who to
trust.  This model is similar to real life relations.

Just see how Charlie behaves in the previous example.  Although he has
signed Bob's key - because he knows, somehow, that it belongs to Bob -
he does not trust Bob to be an introducer.  Charlie decided to trust
only Kevin, for some reason.  A reason could be that Bob is lazy enough,
and signs other people's keys without being sure that they belong to the
actual owner.

4.1.2.1 OpenPGP certificate structure
.....................................

In GnuTLS the OpenPGP certificate structures [_RFC2440_] are handled
using the 'gnutls_openpgp_crt_t' type.  A typical certificate contains
the user ID, which is an RFC 2822 mail and name address, a public key,
possibly a number of additional public keys (called subkeys), and a
number of signatures.  The various fields are shown in *note Table 4.5:
tab:openpgp-certificate.

The additional subkeys may provide key for various different purposes,
e.g.  one key to encrypt mail, and another to sign a TLS key exchange.
Each subkey is identified by a unique key ID. The keys that are to be
used in a TLS key exchange that requires signatures are called
authentication keys in the OpenPGP jargon.  The mapping of TLS key
exchange methods to public keys is shown in *note Table 4.6:
tab:openpgp-key-exchange.

               authentication.

               authentication.
               

Table 4.6: The types of (sub)keys required for the various TLS key
exchange methods.

The corresponding private keys are stored in the
'gnutls_openpgp_privkey_t' type.  All the prototypes for the key
handling functions can be found in 'gnutls/openpgp.h'.

4.1.2.2 Verifying an OpenPGP certificate
........................................

The verification functions of OpenPGP keys, included in GnuTLS, are
simple ones, and do not use the features of the "web of trust".  For
that reason, if the verification needs are complex, the assistance of
external tools like GnuPG and GPGME(1) is recommended.

In GnuTLS there is a verification function for OpenPGP certificates, the
*note gnutls_openpgp_crt_verify_ring::.  This checks an OpenPGP key
against a given set of public keys (keyring) and returns the key status.
The key verification status is the same as in X.509 certificates,
although the meaning and interpretation are different.  For example an
OpenPGP key may be valid, if the self signature is ok, even if no
signers were found.  The meaning of verification status flags is the
same as in the X.509 certificates (see *note Figure 4.3:
gnutls_certificate_verify_flags.).

 -- Function: int gnutls_openpgp_crt_verify_ring (gnutls_openpgp_crt_t
          KEY, gnutls_openpgp_keyring_t KEYRING, unsigned int FLAGS,
          unsigned int * VERIFY)
     KEY: the structure that holds the key.

     KEYRING: holds the keyring to check against

     FLAGS: unused (should be 0)

     VERIFY: will hold the certificate verification output.

     Verify all signatures in the key, using the given set of keys
     (keyring).

     The key verification output will be put in 'verify' and will be one
     or more of the 'gnutls_certificate_status_t' enumerated elements
     bitwise or'd.

     Note that this function does not verify using any "web of trust".
     You may use GnuPG for that purpose, or any other external PGP
     application.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' on success, or an error code.

 -- Function: int gnutls_openpgp_crt_verify_self (gnutls_openpgp_crt_t
          KEY, unsigned int FLAGS, unsigned int * VERIFY)
     KEY: the structure that holds the key.

     FLAGS: unused (should be 0)

     VERIFY: will hold the key verification output.

     Verifies the self signature in the key.  The key verification
     output will be put in 'verify' and will be one or more of the
     gnutls_certificate_status_t enumerated elements bitwise or'd.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' on success, or an error code.

4.1.2.3 Verifying a certificate in the context of a TLS session
...............................................................

Similarly with X.509 certificates, one needs to specify the OpenPGP
keyring file in the credentials structure.  The certificates in this
file will be used by *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3:: to verify
the signatures in the certificate sent by the peer.

 -- Function: int gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_keyring_file
          (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t C, const char * FILE,
          gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t FORMAT)
     C: A certificate credentials structure

     FILE: filename of the keyring.

     FORMAT: format of keyring.

     The function is used to set keyrings that will be used internally
     by various OpenPGP functions.  For example to find a key when it is
     needed for an operations.  The keyring will also be used at the
     verification functions.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

4.1.3 Advanced certificate verification
---------------------------------------

The verification of X.509 certificates in the HTTPS and other Internet
protocols is typically done by loading a trusted list of commercial
Certificate Authorities (see *note
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_system_trust::), and using them as trusted
anchors.  However, there are several examples (eg.  the Diginotar
incident) where one of these authorities was compromised.  This risk can
be mitigated by using in addition to CA certificate verification, other
verification methods.  In this section we list the available in GnuTLS
methods.

* Verifying a certificate using trust on first use authentication::
* Verifying a certificate using DANE::

4.1.3.1 Verifying a certificate using trust on first use authentication
.......................................................................

It is possible to use a trust on first use (TOFU) authentication method
in GnuTLS. That is the concept used by the SSH programs, where the
public key of the peer is not verified, or verified in an out-of-bound
way, but subsequent connections to the same peer require the public key
to remain the same.  Such a system in combination with the typical CA
verification of a certificate, and OCSP revocation checks, can help to
provide multiple factor verification, where a single point of failure is
not enough to compromise the system.  For example a server compromise
may be detected using OCSP, and a CA compromise can be detected using
the trust on first use method.  Such a hybrid system with X.509 and
trust on first use authentication is shown in *note Simple client
example with SSH-style certificate verification::.

See *note Certificate verification:: on how to use the available
functionality.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Verifying a certificate using DANE,  Prev: Verifying a certificate using trust on first use authentication,  Up: Advanced certificate verification

4.1.3.2 Verifying a certificate using DANE (DNSSEC)
...................................................

The DANE protocol is a protocol that can be used to verify TLS
certificates using the DNS (or better DNSSEC) protocols.  The DNS
security extensions (DNSSEC) provide an alternative public key
infrastructure to the commercial CAs that are typically used to sign TLS
certificates.  The DANE protocol takes advantage of the DNSSEC
infrastructure to verify TLS certificates.  This can be in addition to
the verification by CA infrastructure or may even replace it where
DNSSEC is fully deployed.  Note however, that DNSSEC deployment is
fairly new and it would be better to use it as an additional
verification method rather than the only one.

The DANE functionality is provided by the 'libgnutls-dane' library that
is shipped with GnuTLS and the function prototypes are in
'gnutls/dane.h'.  See *note Certificate verification:: for information
on how to use the library.

Note however, that the DANE RFC mandates the verification methods one
should use in addition to the validation via DNSSEC TLSA entries.
GnuTLS doesn't follow that RFC requirement, and the term DANE
verification in this manual refers to the TLSA entry verification.  In
GnuTLS any other verification methods can be used (e.g., PKIX or TOFU)
on top of DANE.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Digital signatures,  Prev: Advanced certificate verification,  Up: Certificate authentication

4.1.4 Digital signatures
------------------------

In this section we will provide some information about digital
signatures, how they work, and give the rationale for disabling some of
the algorithms used.

Digital signatures work by using somebody's secret key to sign some
arbitrary data.  Then anybody else could use the public key of that
person to verify the signature.  Since the data may be arbitrary it is
not suitable input to a cryptographic digital signature algorithm.  For
this reason and also for performance cryptographic hash algorithms are
used to preprocess the input to the signature algorithm.  This works as
long as it is difficult enough to generate two different messages with
the same hash algorithm output.  In that case the same signature could
be used as a proof for both messages.  Nobody wants to sign an innocent
message of donating 1 euro to Greenpeace and find out that he donated
1.000.000 euros to Bad Inc.

For a hash algorithm to be called cryptographic the following three
requirements must hold:

  1. Preimage resistance.  That means the algorithm must be one way and
     given the output of the hash function H(x), it is impossible to
     calculate x.

  2. 2nd preimage resistance.  That means that given a pair x,y with
     y=H(x) it is impossible to calculate an x' such that y=H(x').

  3. Collision resistance.  That means that it is impossible to
     calculate random x and x' such H(x')=H(x).

The last two requirements in the list are the most important in digital
signatures.  These protect against somebody who would like to generate
two messages with the same hash output.  When an algorithm is considered
broken usually it means that the Collision resistance of the algorithm
is less than brute force.  Using the birthday paradox the brute force
attack takes 2^{((hash size) / 2)} operations.  Today colliding
certificates using the MD5 hash algorithm have been generated as shown
in [_WEGER_].

There has been cryptographic results for the SHA-1 hash algorithms as
well, although they are not yet critical.  Before 2004, MD5 had a
presumed collision strength of 2^{64}, but it has been showed to have a
collision strength well under 2^{50}.  As of November 2005, it is
believed that SHA-1's collision strength is around 2^{63}.  We consider
this sufficiently hard so that we still support SHA-1.  We anticipate
that SHA-256/386/512 will be used in publicly-distributed certificates
in the future.  When 2^{63} can be considered too weak compared to the
computer power available sometime in the future, SHA-1 will be disabled
as well.  The collision attacks on SHA-1 may also get better, given the
new interest in tools for creating them.

4.1.4.1 Trading security for interoperability
.............................................

If you connect to a server and use GnuTLS' functions to verify the
certificate chain, and get a 'GNUTLS_CERT_INSECURE_ALGORITHM' validation
error (see *note Verifying X.509 certificate paths::), it means that
somewhere in the certificate chain there is a certificate signed using
'RSA-MD2' or 'RSA-MD5'.  These two digital signature algorithms are
considered broken, so GnuTLS fails verifying the certificate.  In some
situations, it may be useful to be able to verify the certificate chain
anyway, assuming an attacker did not utilize the fact that these
signatures algorithms are broken.  This section will give help on how to
achieve that.

It is important to know that you do not have to enable any of the flags
discussed here to be able to use trusted root CA certificates
self-signed using 'RSA-MD2' or 'RSA-MD5'.  The certificates in the
trusted list are considered trusted irrespective of the signature.

If you are using *note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3:: to verify the
certificate chain, you can call *note
gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags:: with the flags:
   * 'GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD2'
   * 'GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5'
as in the following example:

       gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags (x509cred,
                                            GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5);

This will signal the verifier algorithm to enable 'RSA-MD5' when
verifying the certificates.

If you are using *note gnutls_x509_crt_verify:: or *note
gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify::, you can pass the
'GNUTLS_VERIFY_ALLOW_SIGN_RSA_MD5' parameter directly in the 'flags'
parameter.

If you are using these flags, it may also be a good idea to warn the
user when verification failure occur for this reason.  The simplest is
to not use the flags by default, and only fall back to using them after
warning the user.  If you wish to inspect the certificate chain
yourself, you can use *note gnutls_certificate_get_peers:: to extract
the raw server's certificate chain, *note gnutls_x509_crt_list_import::
to parse each of the certificates, and then *note
gnutls_x509_crt_get_signature_algorithm:: to find out the signing
algorithm used for each certificate.  If any of the intermediary
certificates are using 'GNUTLS_SIGN_RSA_MD2' or 'GNUTLS_SIGN_RSA_MD5',
you could present a warning.

Certificates are not the only structures involved in a public key

File: gnutls.info,  Node: PKCS 10 certificate requests,  Next: PKIX certificate revocation lists,  Up: More on certificate authentication

4.2.1 PKCS #10 certificate requests
-----------------------------------

A certificate request is a structure, which contain information about an
applicant of a certificate service.  It usually contains a private key,
a distinguished name and secondary data such as a challenge password.
GnuTLS supports the requests defined in PKCS #10 [_RFC2986_].  Other
formats of certificate requests are not currently supported.

A certificate request can be generated by associating it with a private
key, setting the subject's information and finally self signing it.  The
last step ensures that the requester is in possession of the private
key.

'INT *note gnutls_x509_crq_set_version:: (gnutls_x509_crq_t CRQ, unsigned int VERSION)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crq_set_dn:: (gnutls_x509_crq_t CRQ, const char * DN, const char ** ERR)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crq_set_dn_by_oid:: (gnutls_x509_crq_t CRQ, const char * OID, unsigned int RAW_FLAG, const void * DATA, unsigned int SIZEOF_DATA)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crq_set_key_usage:: (gnutls_x509_crq_t CRQ, unsigned int USAGE)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crq_set_key_purpose_oid:: (gnutls_x509_crq_t CRQ, const void * OID, unsigned int CRITICAL)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crq_set_basic_constraints:: (gnutls_x509_crq_t CRQ, unsigned int CA, int PATHLENCONSTRAINT)'

The *note gnutls_x509_crq_set_key:: and *note gnutls_x509_crq_sign2::
functions associate the request with a private key and sign it.  If a
request is to be signed with a key residing in a PKCS #11 token it is
recommended to use the signing functions shown in *note Abstract key
types::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crq_set_key (gnutls_x509_crq_t CRQ,

     CRQ: should contain a 'gnutls_x509_crq_t' structure

     KEY: holds a private key

     This function will set the public parameters from the given private
     key to the request.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     KEY: holds a private key

     DIG: The message digest to use, i.e., 'GNUTLS_DIG_SHA1'

     FLAGS: must be 0

     This function will sign the certificate request with a private key.
     This must be the same key as the one used in
     'gnutls_x509_crt_set_key()' since a certificate request is self
     signed.

     This must be the last step in a certificate request generation
     since all the previously set parameters are now signed.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' on success, otherwise a negative
     error code.  'GNUTLS_E_ASN1_VALUE_NOT_FOUND' is returned if you
     didn't set all information in the certificate request (e.g., the
     version using 'gnutls_x509_crq_set_version()' ).

The following example is about generating a certificate request, and a
private key.  A certificate request can be later be processed by a CA
which should return a signed certificate.

A certificate revocation list (CRL) is a structure issued by an
authority periodically containing a list of revoked certificates serial
numbers.  The CRL structure is signed with the issuing authorities'
keys.  A typical CRL contains the fields as shown in *note Table 4.7:
tab:crl.  Certificate revocation lists are used to complement the
expiration date of a certificate, in order to account for other reasons
of revocation, such as compromised keys, etc.

Each CRL is valid for limited amount of time and is required to provide,
except for the current issuing time, also the issuing time of the next
update.

The basic CRL structure functions follow.

'INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_init:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t * CRL)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_import:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT)'

'INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_export:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, void * OUTPUT_DATA, size_t * OUTPUT_DATA_SIZE)'

Reading a CRL
.............

The most important function that extracts the certificate revocation
information from a CRL is *note gnutls_x509_crl_get_crt_serial::.  Other
functions that return other fields of the CRL structure are also
provided.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crl_get_crt_serial (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL,
          int INDX, unsigned char * SERIAL, size_t * SERIAL_SIZE, time_t
          * T)
     CRL: should contain a 'gnutls_x509_crl_t' structure

     INDX: the index of the certificate to extract (starting from 0)

     SERIAL: where the serial number will be copied

     SERIAL_SIZE: initially holds the size of serial

     T: if non null, will hold the time this certificate was revoked

     This function will retrieve the serial number of the specified, by
     the index, revoked certificate.

     Note that this function will have performance issues in large
     sequences of revoked certificates.  In that case use
     'gnutls_x509_crl_iter_crt_serial()' .

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

'INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_get_version:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_get_issuer_dn:: (const gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL, char * BUF, size_t * SIZEOF_BUF)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_get_issuer_dn2:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL, gnutls_datum_t * DN)'
'TIME_T *note gnutls_x509_crl_get_this_update:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL)'
'TIME_T *note gnutls_x509_crl_get_next_update:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_get_crt_count:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL)'

Generation of a CRL
...................

The following functions can be used to generate a CRL.

'INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_set_version:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL, unsigned int VERSION)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_set_crt_serial:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL, const void * SERIAL, size_t SERIAL_SIZE, time_t REVOCATION_TIME)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_set_crt:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL, gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT, time_t REVOCATION_TIME)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_set_next_update:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL, time_t EXP_TIME)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_set_this_update:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL, time_t ACT_TIME)'

The *note gnutls_x509_crl_sign2:: and *note
gnutls_x509_crl_privkey_sign:: functions sign the revocation list with a
private key.  The latter function can be used to sign with a key
residing in a PKCS #11 token.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crl_sign2 (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL,
          gnutls_x509_crt_t ISSUER, gnutls_x509_privkey_t ISSUER_KEY,
          gnutls_digest_algorithm_t DIG, unsigned int FLAGS)
     CRL: should contain a gnutls_x509_crl_t structure

     ISSUER: is the certificate of the certificate issuer

     ISSUER_KEY: holds the issuer's private key

     DIG: The message digest to use.  GNUTLS_DIG_SHA1 is the safe choice
     unless you know what you're doing.

     FLAGS: must be 0

     This function will sign the CRL with the issuer's private key, and
     will copy the issuer's information into the CRL.

     This must be the last step in a certificate CRL since all the
     previously set parameters are now signed.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_crl_privkey_sign (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL,
          gnutls_x509_crt_t ISSUER, gnutls_privkey_t ISSUER_KEY,
          gnutls_digest_algorithm_t DIG, unsigned int FLAGS)
     CRL: should contain a gnutls_x509_crl_t structure

     ISSUER: is the certificate of the certificate issuer

     ISSUER_KEY: holds the issuer's private key

     DIG: The message digest to use.  GNUTLS_DIG_SHA1 is the safe choice
     unless you know what you're doing.

     FLAGS: must be 0

     This function will sign the CRL with the issuer's private key, and
     will copy the issuer's information into the CRL.

     This must be the last step in a certificate CRL since all the
     previously set parameters are now signed.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     Since 2.12.0

Few extensions on the CRL structure are supported, including the CRL
number extension and the authority key identifier.

'INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_set_number:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL, const void * NR, size_t NR_SIZE)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crl_set_authority_key_id:: (gnutls_x509_crl_t CRL, const void * ID, size_t ID_SIZE)'

4.2.3 OCSP certificate status checking
--------------------------------------

Certificates may be revoked before their expiration time has been
reached.  There are several reasons for revoking certificates, but a
typical situation is when the private key associated with a certificate
has been compromised.  Traditionally, Certificate Revocation Lists
(CRLs) have been used by application to implement revocation checking,
however, several problems with CRLs have been identified [_RIVESTCRL_].

The Online Certificate Status Protocol, or OCSP [_RFC2560_], is a widely
implemented protocol to perform certificate revocation status checking.
An application that wish to verify the identity of a peer will verify
the certificate against a set of trusted certificates and then check
whether the certificate is listed in a CRL and/or perform an OCSP check
for the certificate.

Note that in the context of a TLS session the server may provide an OCSP
response that will used during the TLS certificate verification (see
*note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2::).  You may obtain this response
using *note gnutls_ocsp_status_request_get::.

Before performing the OCSP query, the application will need to figure
out the address of the OCSP server.  The OCSP server address can be
provided by the local user in manual configuration or may be stored in
the certificate that is being checked.  When stored in a certificate the
OCSP server is in the extension field called the Authority Information
Access (AIA). The following function extracts this information from a
certificate.

'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_get_authority_info_access:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT, unsigned int SEQ, int WHAT, gnutls_datum_t * DATA, unsigned int * CRITICAL)'

There are several functions in GnuTLS for creating and manipulating OCSP
requests and responses.  The general idea is that a client application
create an OCSP request object, store some information about the
certificate to check in the request, and then export the request in DER
format.  The request will then need to be sent to the OCSP responder,
which needs to be done by the application (GnuTLS does not send and
receive OCSP packets).  Normally an OCSP response is received that the
application will need to import into an OCSP response object.  The
digital signature in the OCSP response needs to be verified against a
set of trust anchors before the information in the response can be
trusted.

The ASN.1 structure of OCSP requests are briefly as follows.  It is
useful to review the structures to get an understanding of which fields
are modified by GnuTLS functions.

     OCSPRequest     ::=     SEQUENCE {
         tbsRequest                  TBSRequest,
         optionalSignature   [0]     EXPLICIT Signature OPTIONAL }

     TBSRequest      ::=     SEQUENCE {
         version             [0]     EXPLICIT Version DEFAULT v1,
         requestorName       [1]     EXPLICIT GeneralName OPTIONAL,
         requestList                 SEQUENCE OF Request,
         requestExtensions   [2]     EXPLICIT Extensions OPTIONAL }

     Request         ::=     SEQUENCE {
         reqCert                     CertID,
         singleRequestExtensions     [0] EXPLICIT Extensions OPTIONAL }

     CertID          ::=     SEQUENCE {
         hashAlgorithm       AlgorithmIdentifier,
         issuerNameHash      OCTET STRING, -- Hash of Issuer's DN
         issuerKeyHash       OCTET STRING, -- Hash of Issuers public key
         serialNumber        CertificateSerialNumber }

The basic functions to initialize, import, export and deallocate OCSP
requests are the following.

'INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_init:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t * REQ)'
'VOID *note gnutls_ocsp_req_deinit:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ)'
'INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_import:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA)'
'INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_export:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, gnutls_datum_t * DATA)'
'INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_print:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, gnutls_ocsp_print_formats_t FORMAT, gnutls_datum_t * OUT)'

To generate an OCSP request the issuer name hash, issuer key hash, and
the checked certificate's serial number are required.  There are two
interfaces available for setting those in an OCSP request.  The is a
low-level function when you have the issuer name hash, issuer key hash,
and certificate serial number in binary form.  The second is more useful
if you have the certificate (and its issuer) in a 'gnutls_x509_crt_t'
type.  There is also a function to extract this information from
existing an OCSP request.

'INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_add_cert_id:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t DIGEST, const gnutls_datum_t * ISSUER_NAME_HASH, const gnutls_datum_t * ISSUER_KEY_HASH, const gnutls_datum_t * SERIAL_NUMBER)'
'INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_add_cert:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t DIGEST, gnutls_x509_crt_t ISSUER, gnutls_x509_crt_t CERT)'
'INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_get_cert_id:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, unsigned INDX, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t * DIGEST, gnutls_datum_t * ISSUER_NAME_HASH, gnutls_datum_t * ISSUER_KEY_HASH, gnutls_datum_t * SERIAL_NUMBER)'

Each OCSP request may contain a number of extensions.  Extensions are
identified by an Object Identifier (OID) and an opaque data buffer whose
syntax and semantics is implied by the OID. You can extract or set those
extensions using the following functions.

'INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_get_extension:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, unsigned INDX, gnutls_datum_t * OID, unsigned int * CRITICAL, gnutls_datum_t * DATA)'
'INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_set_extension:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, const char * OID, unsigned int CRITICAL, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA)'

A common OCSP Request extension is the nonce extension (OID
1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1.2), which is used to avoid replay attacks of earlier
recorded OCSP responses.  The nonce extension carries a value that is
intended to be sufficiently random and unique so that an attacker will
not be able to give a stale response for the same nonce.

'INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_get_nonce:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, unsigned int * CRITICAL, gnutls_datum_t * NONCE)'
'INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_set_nonce:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ, unsigned int CRITICAL, const gnutls_datum_t * NONCE)'
'INT *note gnutls_ocsp_req_randomize_nonce:: (gnutls_ocsp_req_t REQ)'

The OCSP response structures is a complex structure.  A simplified
overview of it is in *note Table 4.8: tab:ocsp-response.  Note that a
response may contain information on multiple certificates.

Table 4.8: The most important OCSP response fields.

We provide basic functions for initialization, importing, exporting and
deallocating OCSP responses.

'INT *note gnutls_ocsp_resp_init:: (gnutls_ocsp_resp_t * RESP)'
'VOID *note gnutls_ocsp_resp_deinit:: (gnutls_ocsp_resp_t RESP)'
'INT *note gnutls_ocsp_resp_import:: (gnutls_ocsp_resp_t RESP, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA)'
'INT *note gnutls_ocsp_resp_export:: (gnutls_ocsp_resp_t RESP, gnutls_datum_t * DATA)'
'INT *note gnutls_ocsp_resp_print:: (gnutls_ocsp_resp_t RESP, gnutls_ocsp_print_formats_t FORMAT, gnutls_datum_t * OUT)'

The utility function that extracts the revocation as well as other
information from a response is shown below.

 -- Function: int gnutls_ocsp_resp_get_single (gnutls_ocsp_resp_t RESP,
          unsigned INDX, gnutls_digest_algorithm_t * DIGEST,
          gnutls_datum_t * ISSUER_NAME_HASH, gnutls_datum_t *
          ISSUER_KEY_HASH, gnutls_datum_t * SERIAL_NUMBER, unsigned int
          * CERT_STATUS, time_t * THIS_UPDATE, time_t * NEXT_UPDATE,
          time_t * REVOCATION_TIME, unsigned int * REVOCATION_REASON)
     RESP: should contain a 'gnutls_ocsp_resp_t' structure

     INDX: Specifies response number to get.  Use (0) to get the first
     one.

     DIGEST: output variable with 'gnutls_digest_algorithm_t' hash
     algorithm

     ISSUER_NAME_HASH: output buffer with hash of issuer's DN

     ISSUER_KEY_HASH: output buffer with hash of issuer's public key

     SERIAL_NUMBER: output buffer with serial number of certificate to
     check

     CERT_STATUS: a certificate status, a 'gnutls_ocsp_cert_status_t'
     enum.

     THIS_UPDATE: time at which the status is known to be correct.

     NEXT_UPDATE: when newer information will be available, or
     (time_t)-1 if unspecified

     REVOCATION_TIME: when 'cert_status' is 'GNUTLS_OCSP_CERT_REVOKED' ,
     holds time of revocation.

     REVOCATION_REASON: revocation reason, a 'gnutls_x509_crl_reason_t'
     enum.

     This function will return the certificate information of the 'indx'
     'ed response in the Basic OCSP Response 'resp' .  The information
     returned corresponds to the OCSP SingleResponse structure except
     the final singleExtensions.

     Each of the pointers to output variables may be NULL to indicate
     that the caller is not interested in that value.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error code is returned.  If you have reached
     the last CertID available 'GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE'
     will be returned.

The possible revocation reasons available in an OCSP response are shown
below.

'GNUTLS_X509_CRLREASON_UNSPECIFIED'
     Unspecified reason.
'GNUTLS_X509_CRLREASON_KEYCOMPROMISE'
     Private key compromised.
'GNUTLS_X509_CRLREASON_CACOMPROMISE'

     Privilege withdrawn.
'GNUTLS_X509_CRLREASON_AACOMPROMISE'
     AA compromised.

Figure 4.5: The revocation reasons

Note, that the OCSP response needs to be verified against some set of
trust anchors before it can be relied upon.  It is also important to
check whether the received OCSP response corresponds to the certificate
being checked.

4.2.4 Managing encrypted keys
-----------------------------

Transferring or storing private keys in plain may not be a good idea,
since any compromise is irreparable.  Storing the keys in hardware
security modules (see *note Smart cards and HSMs::) could solve the
storage problem but it is not always practical or efficient enough.
This section describes ways to store and transfer encrypted private
keys.

There are methods for key encryption, namely the PKCS #8, PKCS #12 and
OpenSSL's custom encrypted private key formats.  The PKCS #8 and the
OpenSSL's method allow encryption of the private key, while the PKCS #12
method allows, in addition, the bundling of accompanying data into the
structure.  That is typically the corresponding certificate, as well as
a trusted CA certificate.

High level functionality
........................

Generic and higher level private key import functions are available,
that import plain or encrypted keys and will auto-detect the encrypted
key format.

 -- Function: int gnutls_privkey_import_x509_raw (gnutls_privkey_t PKEY,
          const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT,
          const char * PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS)
     PKEY: The private key

     DATA: The private key data to be imported

     FORMAT: The format of the private key

     PASSWORD: A password (optional)

     FLAGS: an ORed sequence of gnutls_pkcs_encrypt_flags_t

     This function will import the given private key to the abstract
     'gnutls_privkey_t' structure.

     The supported formats are basic unencrypted key, PKCS8, PKCS12, and
     the openssl format.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_privkey_import2 (gnutls_x509_privkey_t
          KEY, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t
          FORMAT, const char * PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS)
     KEY: The structure to store the parsed key

     DATA: The DER or PEM encoded key.

     FORMAT: One of DER or PEM

     PASSWORD: A password (optional)

     FLAGS: an ORed sequence of gnutls_pkcs_encrypt_flags_t

     This function will import the given DER or PEM encoded key, to the
     native 'gnutls_x509_privkey_t' format, irrespective of the input
     format.  The input format is auto-detected.

     The supported formats are basic unencrypted key, PKCS8, PKCS12, and
     the openssl format.

     If the provided key is encrypted but no password was given, then
     'GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED' is returned.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

Any keys imported using those functions can be imported to a certificate
credentials structure using *note gnutls_certificate_set_key::, or
alternatively they can be directly imported using *note
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2::.

PKCS #8 structures
..................

PKCS #8 keys can be imported and exported as normal private keys using
the functions below.  An addition to the normal import functions, are a
password and a flags argument.  The flags can be any element of the
'gnutls_pkcs_encrypt_flags_t' enumeration.  Note however, that GnuTLS
only supports the PKCS #5 PBES2 encryption scheme.  Keys encrypted with
the obsolete PBES1 scheme cannot be decrypted.

'INT *note gnutls_x509_privkey_import_pkcs8:: (gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, const char * PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_privkey_export_pkcs8:: (gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, const char * PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS, void * OUTPUT_DATA, size_t * OUTPUT_DATA_SIZE)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_privkey_export2_pkcs8:: (gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, const char * PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS, gnutls_datum_t * OUT)'

'GNUTLS_PKCS_PLAIN'
     Unencrypted private key.
'GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PKCS12_3DES'
     PKCS-12 3DES.
'GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PKCS12_ARCFOUR'
     PKCS-12 ARCFOUR.
'GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PKCS12_RC2_40'
     PKCS-12 RC2-40.
'GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PBES2_3DES'
     PBES2 3DES.
'GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PBES2_AES_128'
     PBES2 AES-128.
'GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PBES2_AES_192'
     PBES2 AES-192.
'GNUTLS_PKCS_USE_PBES2_AES_256'
     PBES2 AES-256.
'GNUTLS_PKCS_NULL_PASSWORD'
     Some schemas distinguish between an empty and a NULL password.

Figure 4.6: Encryption flags

PKCS #12 structures
...................

A PKCS #12 structure [_PKCS12_] usually contains a user's private keys
and certificates.  It is commonly used in browsers to export and import
the user's identities.  A file containing such a key can be directly
imported to a certificate credentials structure by using *note
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_simple_pkcs12_file::.

In GnuTLS the PKCS #12 structures are handled using the
'gnutls_pkcs12_t' type.  This is an abstract type that may hold several
'gnutls_pkcs12_bag_t' types.  The bag types are the holders of the
actual data, which may be certificates, private keys or encrypted data.
A bag of type encrypted should be decrypted in order for its data to be
accessed.

To reduce the complexity in parsing the structures the simple helper
function *note gnutls_pkcs12_simple_parse:: is provided.  For more
advanced uses, manual parsing of the structure is required using the
functions below.

'INT *note gnutls_pkcs12_get_bag:: (gnutls_pkcs12_t PKCS12, int INDX, gnutls_pkcs12_bag_t BAG)'
'INT *note gnutls_pkcs12_verify_mac:: (gnutls_pkcs12_t PKCS12, const char * PASS)'

     P12: the PKCS12 blob.

     PASSWORD: optional password used to decrypt PKCS12 blob, bags and
     keys.

     KEY: a structure to store the parsed private key.

     CHAIN: the corresponding to key certificate chain (may be 'NULL' )

     CHAIN_LEN: will be updated with the number of additional (may be
     'NULL' )

     EXTRA_CERTS: optional pointer to receive an array of additional
     certificates found in the PKCS12 blob (may be 'NULL' ).

     EXTRA_CERTS_LEN: will be updated with the number of additional
     certs (may be 'NULL' ).

     CRL: an optional structure to store the parsed CRL (may be 'NULL'
     ).

     FLAGS: should be zero or one of GNUTLS_PKCS12_SP_*

     This function parses a PKCS12 blob in 'p12blob' and extracts the
     private key, the corresponding certificate chain, any additional
     certificates and a CRL.

     The 'extra_certs' and 'extra_certs_len' parameters are optional and
     both may be set to 'NULL' .  If either is non-'NULL' , then both
     must be set.  The value for 'extra_certs' is allocated using
     'gnutls_malloc()' .

     Encrypted PKCS12 bags and PKCS8 private keys are supported, but
     only with password based security and the same password for all
     operations.

     Note that a PKCS12 file may contain many keys and/or certificates,
     and there is no way to identify which key/certificate pair you
     want.  For this reason this function is useful for PKCS12 files
     that contain only one key/certificate pair and/or one CRL.

     If the provided structure has encrypted fields but no password is
     provided then this function returns 'GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED' .

     Note that normally the chain constructed does not include self
     signed certificates, to comply with TLS' requirements.  If,
     however, the flag 'GNUTLS_PKCS12_SP_INCLUDE_SELF_SIGNED' is
     specified then self signed certificates will be included in the
     chain.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

OpenSSL encrypted keys
......................

Unfortunately the structures discussed in the previous sections are not
the only structures that may hold an encrypted private key.  For example
the OpenSSL library offers a custom key encryption method.  Those
structures are also supported in GnuTLS with *note
gnutls_x509_privkey_import_openssl::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_x509_privkey_import_openssl
          (gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, const
          char * PASSWORD)
     KEY: The structure to store the parsed key

     DATA: The DER or PEM encoded key.

     PASSWORD: the password to decrypt the key (if it is encrypted).

     This function will convert the given PEM encrypted to the native
     gnutls_x509_privkey_t format.  The output will be stored in 'key' .

     The 'password' should be in ASCII. If the password is not provided
     or wrong then 'GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED' will be returned.

     If the Certificate is PEM encoded it should have a header of
     "PRIVATE KEY" and the "DEK-Info" header.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

4.2.5 Invoking certtool
-----------------------

Tool to parse and generate X.509 certificates, requests and private
keys.  It can be used interactively or non interactively by specifying
the template command line option.

The tool accepts files or URLs supported by GnuTLS. In case PIN is
required for the URL access you can provide it using the environment
variables GNUTLS_PIN and GNUTLS_SO_PIN.

This section was generated by *AutoGen*, using the 'agtexi-cmd' template
and the option descriptions for the 'certtool' program.  This software
is released under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later.

certtool help/usage ('--help')
..............................

This is the automatically generated usage text for certtool.

The text printed is the same whether selected with the 'help' option
('--help') or the 'more-help' option ('--more-help').  'more-help' will
print the usage text by passing it through a pager program.  'more-help'
is disabled on platforms without a working 'fork(2)' function.  The
'PAGER' environment variable is used to select the program, defaulting
to 'more'.  Both will exit with a status code of 0.

certtool Examples
.................

Generating private keys
.......................

To create an RSA private key, run:
     $ certtool --generate-privkey --outfile key.pem --rsa

To create a DSA or elliptic curves (ECDSA) private key use the above
command combined with 'dsa' or 'ecc' options.

Generating certificate requests
...............................

To create a certificate request (needed when the certificate is issued
by another party), run:
     certtool --generate-request --load-privkey key.pem \
        --outfile request.pem

If the private key is stored in a smart card you can generate a request
by specifying the private key object URL.
     $ ./certtool --generate-request --load-privkey "pkcs11:..." \
       --load-pubkey "pkcs11:..." --outfile request.pem

Generating a self-signed certificate
....................................

To create a self signed certificate, use the command:
     $ certtool --generate-privkey --outfile ca-key.pem
     $ certtool --generate-self-signed --load-privkey ca-key.pem \
        --outfile ca-cert.pem

Note that a self-signed certificate usually belongs to a certificate
authority, that signs other certificates.

Generating a certificate
........................

To generate a certificate using the previous request, use the command:
     $ certtool --generate-certificate --load-request request.pem \
        --outfile cert.pem --load-ca-certificate ca-cert.pem \
        --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem

To generate a certificate using the private key only, use the command:
     $ certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey key.pem \
        --outfile cert.pem --load-ca-certificate ca-cert.pem \
        --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem

Certificate information
.......................

To view the certificate information, use:
     $ certtool --certificate-info --infile cert.pem

PKCS #12 structure generation
.............................

To generate a PKCS #12 structure using the previous key and certificate,
use the command:
     $ certtool --load-certificate cert.pem --load-privkey key.pem \
        --to-p12 --outder --outfile key.p12

Some tools (reportedly web browsers) have problems with that file
because it does not contain the CA certificate for the certificate.  To
work around that problem in the tool, you can use the
-load-ca-certificate parameter as follows:

     $ certtool --load-ca-certificate ca.pem \
       --load-certificate cert.pem --load-privkey key.pem \
       --to-p12 --outder --outfile key.p12

Diffie-Hellman parameter generation
...................................

To generate parameters for Diffie-Hellman key exchange, use the command:
     $ certtool --generate-dh-params --outfile dh.pem --sec-param medium

Proxy certificate generation
............................

Proxy certificate can be used to delegate your credential to a
temporary, typically short-lived, certificate.  To create one from the
previously created certificate, first create a temporary key and then
generate a proxy certificate for it, using the commands:

     $ certtool --generate-privkey > proxy-key.pem
     $ certtool --generate-proxy --load-ca-privkey key.pem \
       --load-privkey proxy-key.pem --load-certificate cert.pem \
       --outfile proxy-cert.pem

Certificate revocation list generation
......................................

To create an empty Certificate Revocation List (CRL) do:

     $ certtool --generate-crl --load-ca-privkey x509-ca-key.pem \
                --load-ca-certificate x509-ca.pem

To create a CRL that contains some revoked certificates, place the
certificates in a file and use '--load-certificate' as follows:

     $ certtool --generate-crl --load-ca-privkey x509-ca-key.pem \
       --load-ca-certificate x509-ca.pem --load-certificate revoked-certs.pem

To verify a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) do:

     $ certtool --verify-crl --load-ca-certificate x509-ca.pem < crl.pem

Certtool's template file format
...............................

A template file can be used to avoid the interactive questions of
certtool.  Initially create a file named 'cert.cfg' that contains the
information about the certificate.  The template can be used as below:

     $ certtool --generate-certificate --load-privkey key.pem  \
        --template cert.cfg --outfile cert.pem \
        --load-ca-certificate ca-cert.pem --load-ca-privkey ca-key.pem

An example certtool template file that can be used to generate a
certificate request or a self signed certificate follows.

     # X.509 Certificate options

     # DN options

     # The organization of the subject.

-----------------------

Ocsptool is a program that can parse and print information about OCSP
requests/responses, generate requests and verify responses.

This section was generated by *AutoGen*, using the 'agtexi-cmd' template
and the option descriptions for the 'ocsptool' program.  This software
is released under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later.

ocsptool help/usage ('--help')
..............................

This is the automatically generated usage text for ocsptool.

The text printed is the same whether selected with the 'help' option
('--help') or the 'more-help' option ('--more-help').  'more-help' will
print the usage text by passing it through a pager program.  'more-help'
is disabled on platforms without a working 'fork(2)' function.  The
'PAGER' environment variable is used to select the program, defaulting
to 'more'.  Both will exit with a status code of 0.

     requests/responses, generate requests and verify responses.


debug option (-d)
.................

This is the "enable debugging" option.  This option takes a number
argument.  Specifies the debug level.

ask option
..........

This is the "ask an ocsp/http server on a certificate validity" option.
This option takes an optional string argument 'server name|url'.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * must appear in combination with the following options: load-cert,
     load-issuer.

Connects to the specified HTTP OCSP server and queries on the validity
of the loaded certificate.

ocsptool exit status
....................

One of the following exit values will be returned:
'0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)'
     Successful program execution.
'1 (EXIT_FAILURE)'
     The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.

ocsptool Examples
.................

Print information about an OCSP request
.......................................

To parse an OCSP request and print information about the content, the
'-i' or '--request-info' parameter may be used as follows.  The '-Q'
parameter specify the name of the file containing the OCSP request, and
it should contain the OCSP request in binary DER format.

     $ ocsptool -i -Q ocsp-request.der

The input file may also be sent to standard input like this:

     $ cat ocsp-request.der | ocsptool --request-info

Print information about an OCSP response
........................................

Similar to parsing OCSP requests, OCSP responses can be parsed using the
'-j' or '--response-info' as follows.

     $ ocsptool -j -Q ocsp-response.der
     $ cat ocsp-response.der | ocsptool --response-info

Generate an OCSP request
........................

The '-q' or '--generate-request' parameters are used to generate an OCSP
request.  By default the OCSP request is written to standard output in
binary DER format, but can be stored in a file using '--outfile'.  To
generate an OCSP request the issuer of the certificate to check needs to
be specified with '--load-issuer' and the certificate to check with
'--load-cert'.  By default PEM format is used for these files, although
'--inder' can be used to specify that the input files are in DER format.

     $ ocsptool -q --load-issuer issuer.pem --load-cert client.pem \
                --outfile ocsp-request.der

When generating OCSP requests, the tool will add an OCSP extension
containing a nonce.  This behaviour can be disabled by specifying
'--no-nonce'.

Verify signature in OCSP response
.................................

To verify the signature in an OCSP response the '-e' or
'--verify-response' parameter is used.  The tool will read an OCSP
response in DER format from standard input, or from the file specified
by '--load-response'.  The OCSP response is verified against a set of
trust anchors, which are specified using '--load-trust'.  The trust
anchors are concatenated certificates in PEM format.  The certificate
that signed the OCSP response needs to be in the set of trust anchors,
or the issuer of the signer certificate needs to be in the set of trust
anchors and the OCSP Extended Key Usage bit has to be asserted in the
signer certificate.

     $ ocsptool -e --load-trust issuer.pem \
                --load-response ocsp-response.der

The tool will print status of verification.

Verify signature in OCSP response against given certificate
...........................................................

It is possible to override the normal trust logic if you know that a
certain certificate is supposed to have signed the OCSP response, and
you want to use it to check the signature.  This is achieved using
'--load-signer' instead of '--load-trust'.  This will load one
certificate and it will be used to verify the signature in the OCSP
response.  It will not check the Extended Key Usage bit.

     $ ocsptool -e --load-signer ocsp-signer.pem \
                --load-response ocsp-response.der

This approach is normally only relevant in two situations.  The first is
when the OCSP response does not contain a copy of the signer
certificate, so the '--load-trust' code would fail.  The second is if
you want to avoid the indirect mode where the OCSP response signer
certificate is signed by a trust anchor.

Real-world example
..................

Here is an example of how to generate an OCSP request for a certificate
and to verify the response.  For illustration we'll use the
'blog.josefsson.org' host, which (as of writing) uses a certificate from
CACert.  First we'll use 'gnutls-cli' to get a copy of the server
certificate chain.  The server is not required to send this information,
but this particular one is configured to do so.

     $ echo | gnutls-cli -p 443 blog.josefsson.org --print-cert > chain.pem

Use a text editor on 'chain.pem' to create three files for each separate
certificates, called 'cert.pem' for the first certificate for the domain
itself, secondly 'issuer.pem' for the intermediate certificate and
'root.pem' for the final root certificate.

The domain certificate normally contains a pointer to where the OCSP
responder is located, in the Authority Information Access Information
extension.  For example, from 'certtool -i < cert.pem' there is this
information:

     Authority Information Access Information (not critical):
     Access Method: 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1 (id-ad-ocsp)
     Access Location URI: http://ocsp.CAcert.org/

This means the CA support OCSP queries over HTTP. We are now ready to
create a OCSP request for the certificate.

     $ ocsptool --ask ocsp.CAcert.org --load-issuer issuer.pem \
                --load-cert cert.pem --outfile ocsp-response.der

The request is sent via HTTP to the OCSP server address specified.  If
the address is ommited ocsptool will use the address stored in the
certificate.

This is the "check a host's dane tlsa entry" option.  This option takes
a string argument.  Obtains the DANE TLSA entry from the given hostname
and prints information.  Note that the actual certificate of the host
can be provided using -load-certificate, otherwise danetool will connect
to the server to obtain it.  The exit code on verification success will
be zero.

check-ee option
...............

This is the "check only the end-entity's certificate" option.  Checks
the end-entity's certificate only.  Trust anchors or CAs are not
considered.

check-ca option
...............

This is the "check only the ca's certificate" option.  Checks the trust
anchor's and CA's certificate only.  End-entities are not considered.

tlsa-rr option
..............

This is the "print the dane rr data on a certificate or public key"
option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * must appear in combination with the following options: host.

This command prints the DANE RR data needed to enable DANE on a DNS
server.

host option
...........

This is the "specify the hostname to be used in the dane rr" option.
This option takes a string argument 'Hostname'.  This command sets the
hostname for the DANE RR.

proto option
............

This is the "the protocol set for dane data (tcp, udp etc.)"  option.
This option takes a string argument 'Protocol'.  This command specifies
the protocol for the service set in the DANE data.

app-proto option
................

This is the "the application protocol to be used to obtain the server's
certificate (https, smtp, imap)" option.  This option takes a string
argument.  When the server's certificate isn't provided danetool will
connect to the server to obtain the certificate.  In that case it is
required to known the protocol to talk with the server prior to
initiating the TLS handshake.

ca option
.........

This is the "whether the provided certificate or public key is a
certificate authority" option.  Marks the DANE RR as a CA certificate if
specified.

x509 option
...........

This is the "use the hash of the x.509 certificate, rather than the
public key" option.  This option forces the generated record to contain
the hash of the full X.509 certificate.  By default only the hash of the
public key is used.

local option
............

This is an alias for the 'domain' option, *note the domain option
documentation: danetool domain.

domain option
.............

This is the "the provided certificate or public key is issued by the
local domain" option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * can be disabled with -no-domain.
   * It is enabled by default.

DANE distinguishes certificates and public keys offered via the DNSSEC
to trusted and local entities.  This flag indicates that this is a
domain-issued certificate, meaning that there could be no CA involved.

local-dns option
................

This is the "use the local dns server for dnssec resolving" option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * can be disabled with -no-local-dns.

This option will use the local DNS server for DNSSEC. This is disabled
by default due to many servers not allowing DNSSEC.

insecure option
...............

This is the "do not verify any dnssec signature" option.  Ignores any
DNSSEC signature verification results.

inder option
............

This is the "use der format for input certificates and private keys"
option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * can be disabled with -no-inder.

The input files will be assumed to be in DER or RAW format.  Unlike
options that in PEM input would allow multiple input data (e.g.
multiple certificates), when reading in DER format a single data
structure is read.

inraw option
............

This is an alias for the 'inder' option, *note the inder option
documentation: danetool inder.

print-raw option
................

This is the "print the received dane data in raw format" option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * can be disabled with -no-print-raw.

This option will print the received DANE data.

quiet option
............

This is the "suppress several informational messages" option.  In that
case on the exit code can be used as an indication of verification
success

danetool exit status
....................

One of the following exit values will be returned:
'0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)'
     Successful program execution.
'1 (EXIT_FAILURE)'
     The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.

DANE TLSA RR generation
.......................

To create a DANE TLSA resource record for a certificate (or public key)
that was issued localy and may or may not be signed by a CA use the
following command.
     $ danetool --tlsa-rr --host www.example.com --load-certificate cert.pem

To create a DANE TLSA resource record for a CA signed certificate, which
will be marked as such use the following command.
     $ danetool --tlsa-rr --host www.example.com --load-certificate cert.pem \
       --no-domain

The former is useful to add in your DNS entry even if your certificate
is signed by a CA. That way even users who do not trust your CA will be
able to verify your certificate using DANE.

In order to create a record for the CA signer of your certificate use
the following.
     $ danetool --tlsa-rr --host www.example.com --load-certificate cert.pem \
       --ca --no-domain

To read a server's DANE TLSA entry, use:
     $ danetool --check www.example.com --proto tcp --port 443

To verify a server's DANE TLSA entry, use:
     $ danetool --check www.example.com --proto tcp --port 443 --load-certificate chain.pem

4.3.1.1 Authentication using SRP
................................

GnuTLS supports authentication via the Secure Remote Password or SRP
protocol (see [_RFC2945,TOMSRP_] for a description).  The SRP key
exchange is an extension to the TLS protocol, and it provides an
authenticated with a password key exchange.  The peers can be identified
using a single password, or there can be combinations where the client
is authenticated using SRP and the server using a certificate.

The advantage of SRP authentication, over other proposed secure password
authentication schemes, is that SRP is not susceptible to off-line
dictionary attacks.  Moreover, SRP does not require the server to hold
the user's password.  This kind of protection is similar to the one used
traditionally in the UNIX '/etc/passwd' file, where the contents of this
file did not cause harm to the system security if they were revealed.
The SRP needs instead of the plain password something called a verifier,
which is calculated using the user's password, and if stolen cannot be
used to impersonate the user.

Typical conventions in SRP are a password file, called 'tpasswd' that
holds the SRP verifiers (encoded passwords) and another file,
'tpasswd.conf', which holds the allowed SRP parameters.  The included in
GnuTLS helper follow those conventions.  The srptool program, discussed
in the next section is a tool to manipulate the SRP parameters.

The implementation in GnuTLS is based on [_TLSSRP_]. The supported key
exchange methods are shown below.

'SRP:'
     Authentication using the SRP protocol.

'SRP_DSS:'
     Client authentication using the SRP protocol.  Server is
     authenticated using a certificate with DSA parameters.

'SRP_RSA:'
     Client authentication using the SRP protocol.  Server is
     authenticated using a certificate with RSA parameters.

 -- Function: int gnutls_srp_verifier (const char * USERNAME, const char
          * PASSWORD, const gnutls_datum_t * SALT, const gnutls_datum_t
          * GENERATOR, const gnutls_datum_t * PRIME, gnutls_datum_t *
          RES)
     USERNAME: is the user's name

     PASSWORD: is the user's password

     SALT: should be some randomly generated bytes

     GENERATOR: is the generator of the group

     PRIME: is the group's prime

     RES: where the verifier will be stored.

     This function will create an SRP verifier, as specified in RFC2945.
     The 'prime' and 'generator' should be one of the static parameters
     defined in gnutls/gnutls.h or may be generated.

     The verifier will be allocated with 'gnutls_malloc' () and will be
     stored in 'res' using binary format.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned, or an
     error code.

In brief, to use SRP you need to create two files.  These are the
password file that holds the users and the verifiers associated with
them and the configuration file to hold the group parameters (called
tpasswd.conf).

4.3.2.1 Authentication using PSK
................................

Authentication using Pre-shared keys is a method to authenticate using
usernames and binary keys.  This protocol avoids making use of public
key infrastructure and expensive calculations, thus it is suitable for
constraint clients.

The implementation in GnuTLS is based on [_TLSPSK_]. The supported PSK
key exchange methods are:

'PSK:'
     Authentication using the PSK protocol.

'DHE-PSK:'
     Authentication using the PSK protocol and Diffie-Hellman key
     exchange.  This method offers perfect forward secrecy.

'ECDHE-PSK:'
     Authentication using the PSK protocol and Elliptic curve
     Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  This method offers perfect forward
     secrecy.

'RSA-PSK:'
     Authentication using the PSK protocol for the client and an RSA
     certificate for the server.

Helper functions to generate and maintain PSK keys are also included in
GnuTLS.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Anonymous authentication,  Prev: PSK authentication,  Up: Shared-key and anonymous authentication

4.3.3 Anonymous authentication
------------------------------

The anonymous key exchange offers encryption without any indication of
the peer's identity.  This kind of authentication is vulnerable to a man
in the middle attack, but can be used even if there is no prior
communication or shared trusted parties with the peer.  It is useful to
establish a session over which certificate authentication will occur in
order to hide the indentities of the participants from passive
eavesdroppers.

Unless in the above case, it is not recommended to use anonymous
authentication.  In the cases where there is no prior communication with
the peers, an alternative with better properties, such as key
continuity, is trust on first use (see *note Verifying a certificate
using trust on first use authentication::).

The available key exchange algorithms for anonymous authentication are
shown below, but note that few public servers support them, and they
have to be explicitly enabled.

'ANON_DH:'
     This algorithm exchanges Diffie-Hellman parameters.

'ANON_ECDH:'
     This algorithm exchanges elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman parameters.
     It is more efficient than ANON_DH on equivalent security levels.

4.4 Selecting an appropriate authentication method
==================================================

This section provides some guidance on how to use the available
authentication methods in GnuTLS in various scenarios.

4.4.1 Two peers with an out-of-band channel
-------------------------------------------

Let's consider two peers need to communicate over an untrusted channel
(the Internet), but have an out-of-band channel available.  The latter
channel is considered safe from eavesdropping and message modification
and thus can be used for an initial bootstrapping of the protocol.  The
options available are:
   * Pre-shared keys (see *note PSK authentication::).  The server and a
     client communicate a shared randomly generated key over the trusted
     channel and use it to negotiate further sessions over the untrusted
     channel.

   * Passwords (see *note SRP authentication::).  The client
     communicates to the server his username and password of choice and
     uses it to negotiate further sessions over the untrusted channel.

   * Public keys (see *note Certificate authentication::).  The client
     and the server exchange their public keys (or fingerprints of them)
     over the trusted channel.  On future sessions over the untrusted
     channel they verify the key being the same (similar to *note
     Verifying a certificate using trust on first use authentication::).

Provided that the out-of-band channel is trusted all of the above
provide a similar level of protection.  An out-of-band channel may be
the initial bootstrapping of a user's PC in a corporate environment,
in-person communication, communication over an alternative network (e.g.
the phone network), etc.

4.4.2 Two peers without an out-of-band channel
----------------------------------------------

When an out-of-band channel is not available a peer cannot be reliably
authenticated.  What can be done, however, is to allow some form of
registration of users connecting for the first time and ensure that
their keys remain the same after that initial connection.  This is
termed key continuity or trust on first use (TOFU).

The available option is to use public key authentication (see *note
Certificate authentication::).  The client and the server store each
other's public keys (or fingerprints of them) and associate them with
their identity.  On future sessions over the untrusted channel they
verify the keys being the same (see *note Verifying a certificate using
trust on first use authentication::).

To mitigate the uncertainty of the information exchanged in the first
connection other channels over the Internet may be used, e.g., DNSSEC
(see *note Verifying a certificate using DANE::).

4.4.3 Two peers and a trusted third party
-----------------------------------------

When a trusted third party is available (or a certificate authority) the
most suitable option is to use certificate authentication (see *note
Certificate authentication::).  The client and the server obtain
certificates that associate their identity and public keys using a
digital signature by the trusted party and use them to on the subsequent
communications with each other.  Each party verifies the peer's
certificate using the trusted third party's signature.  The parameters
of the third party's signature are present in its certificate which must
be available to all communicating parties.

While the above is the typical authentication method for servers in the
Internet by using the commercial CAs, the users that act as clients in
the protocol rarely possess such certificates.  In that case a hybrid
method can be used where the server is authenticated by the client using
the commercial CAs and the client is authenticated based on some
information the client provided over the initial server-authenticated
channel.  The available options are:
   * Passwords (see *note SRP authentication::).  The client
     communicates to the server his username and password of choice on
     the initial server-authenticated connection and uses it to
     negotiate further sessions.  This is possible because the SRP
     protocol allows for the server to be authenticated using a
     certificate and the client using the password.

   * Public keys (see *note Certificate authentication::).  The client
     sends its public key to the server (or a fingerprint of it) over
     the initial server-authenticated connection.  On future sessions
     the client verifies the server using the third party certificate
     and the server verifies that the client's public key remained the
     same (see *note Verifying a certificate using trust on first use
     authentication::).

5 Hardware security modules and abstract key types
**************************************************

In several cases storing the long term cryptographic keys in a hard disk
or even in memory poses a significant risk.  Once the system they are
stored is compromised the keys must be replaced as the secrecy of future
sessions is no longer guarranteed.  Moreover, past sessions that were
not protected by a perfect forward secrecy offering ciphersuite are also
to be assumed compromised.

If such threats need to be addressed, then it may be wise storing the
keys in a security module such as a smart card, an HSM or the TPM chip.
Those modules ensure the protection of the cryptographic keys by only
allowing operations on them and preventing their extraction.  The
purpose of the abstract key API is to provide an API that will allow the
handle of keys in memory and files, as well as keys stored in such
modules.

In GnuTLS the approach is to handle all keys transparently by the high
level API, e.g., the API that loads a key or certificate from a file.
The high-level API will accept URIs in addition to files that specify
keys on an HSM or in TPM, and a callback function will be used to obtain
any required keys.  The URI format is defined in [_TPMURI_] and
[_PKCS11URI_], and is in the process of being standardized across
systems.

More information on the API is provided in the next sections.  Examples
of a URI of a certificate stored in an HSM, as well as a key stored in
the TPM chip are shown below.  To discover the URIs of the objects the
'p11tool' (see *note p11tool Invocation::), or 'tpmtool' (see *note
tpmtool Invocation::) may be used.

5.1 Abstract key types
======================

Since there are many forms of a public or private keys supported by
GnuTLS such as X.509, OpenPGP, PKCS #11 or TPM it is desirable to allow
common operations on them.  For these reasons the abstract
'gnutls_privkey_t' and 'gnutls_pubkey_t' were introduced in
'gnutls/abstract.h' header.  Those types are initialized using a
specific type of key and then can be used to perform operations in an
abstract way.  For example in order to sign an X.509 certificate with a
key that resides in a token the following steps can be used.

     #inlude <gnutls/abstract.h>

     void sign_cert( gnutls_x509_crt_t to_be_signed)
     {
     gnutls_x509_crt_t ca_cert;
     gnutls_privkey_t abs_key;

       /* initialize the abstract key */
       gnutls_privkey_init(&abs_key);

       /* keys stored in tokens are identified by URLs */
       gnutls_privkey_import_url(abs_key, key_url);

       gnutls_x509_crt_init(&ca_cert);
       gnutls_x509_crt_import_pkcs11_url(&ca_cert, cert_url);

       /* sign the certificate to be signed */
       gnutls_x509_crt_privkey_sign(to_be_signed, ca_cert, abs_key,
                                    GNUTLS_DIG_SHA256, 0);

5.1.1 Public keys
-----------------

An abstract 'gnutls_pubkey_t' can be initialized using the functions
below.  It can be imported through an existing structure like
'gnutls_x509_crt_t', or through an ASN.1 encoding of the X.509
'SubjectPublicKeyInfo' sequence.

'INT *note gnutls_pubkey_import_x509:: (gnutls_pubkey_t KEY, gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_pubkey_import_openpgp:: (gnutls_pubkey_t KEY, gnutls_openpgp_crt_t CRT, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_pubkey_import_pkcs11:: (gnutls_pubkey_t KEY, gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t OBJ, unsigned int FLAGS)'

'INT *note gnutls_pubkey_import_url:: (gnutls_pubkey_t KEY, const char * URL, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_pubkey_import_privkey:: (gnutls_pubkey_t KEY, gnutls_privkey_t PKEY, unsigned int USAGE, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_pubkey_import:: (gnutls_pubkey_t KEY, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT)'
'INT *note gnutls_pubkey_export:: (gnutls_pubkey_t KEY, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, void * OUTPUT_DATA, size_t * OUTPUT_DATA_SIZE)'

 -- Function: int gnutls_pubkey_export2 (gnutls_pubkey_t KEY,
          gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, gnutls_datum_t * OUT)
     KEY: Holds the certificate

     FORMAT: the format of output params.  One of PEM or DER.

     OUT: will contain a certificate PEM or DER encoded

     This function will export the public key to DER or PEM format.  The
     contents of the exported data is the SubjectPublicKeyInfo X.509
     structure.

     The output buffer will be allocated using 'gnutls_malloc()' .

     If the structure is PEM encoded, it will have a header of "BEGIN
     CERTIFICATE".

     *Returns:* In case of failure a negative error code will be
     returned, and 0 on success.

     *Since:* 3.1.3

Other helper functions that allow directly importing from raw X.509 or
OpenPGP structures are shown below.

'INT *note gnutls_pubkey_import_x509_raw:: (gnutls_pubkey_t PKEY, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_pubkey_import_openpgp_raw:: (gnutls_pubkey_t PKEY, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, const gnutls_openpgp_keyid_t KEYID, unsigned int FLAGS)'

An important function is *note gnutls_pubkey_import_url:: which will
import public keys from URLs that identify objects stored in tokens (see
*note Smart cards and HSMs:: and *note Trusted Platform Module::).  A
function to check for a supported by GnuTLS URL is *note
gnutls_url_is_supported::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_url_is_supported (const char * URL)
     URL: A PKCS 11 url

     Check whether url is supported.  Depending on the system libraries
     GnuTLS may support pkcs11 or tpmkey URLs.

     *Returns:* return non-zero if the given URL is supported, and zero
     if it is not known.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

Additional functions are available that will return information over a
public key, such as a unique key ID, as well as a function that given a
public key fingerprint would provide a memorable sketch.

Note that *note gnutls_pubkey_get_key_id:: calculates a SHA1 digest of
the public key as a DER-formatted, subjectPublicKeyInfo object.  Other
implementations use different approaches, e.g., some use the "common
method" described in section 4.2.1.2 of [_RFC5280_] which calculates a
digest on a part of the subjectPublicKeyInfo object.

'INT *note gnutls_pubkey_get_pk_algorithm:: (gnutls_pubkey_t KEY, unsigned int * BITS)'

'INT *note gnutls_random_art:: (gnutls_random_art_t TYPE, const char * KEY_TYPE, unsigned int KEY_SIZE, void * FPR, size_t FPR_SIZE, gnutls_datum_t * ART)'

To export the key-specific parameters, or obtain a unique key ID the
following functions are provided.

'INT *note gnutls_pubkey_export_rsa_raw:: (gnutls_pubkey_t KEY, gnutls_datum_t * M, gnutls_datum_t * E)'

5.1.2 Private keys
------------------

An abstract 'gnutls_privkey_t' can be initialized using the functions
below.  It can be imported through an existing structure like
'gnutls_x509_privkey_t', but unlike public keys it cannot be exported.
That is to allow abstraction over keys stored in hardware that makes
available only operations.

'INT *note gnutls_privkey_import_x509:: (gnutls_privkey_t PKEY, gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_privkey_import_openpgp:: (gnutls_privkey_t PKEY, gnutls_openpgp_privkey_t KEY, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_privkey_import_pkcs11:: (gnutls_privkey_t PKEY, gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_t KEY, unsigned int FLAGS)'

Other helper functions that allow directly importing from raw X.509 or
OpenPGP structures are shown below.  Again, as with public keys, private
keys can be imported from a hardware module using URLs.

'INT *note gnutls_privkey_import_x509_raw:: (gnutls_privkey_t PKEY, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, const char * PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_privkey_import_openpgp_raw:: (gnutls_privkey_t PKEY, const gnutls_datum_t * DATA, gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, const gnutls_openpgp_keyid_t KEYID, const char * PASSWORD)'

 -- Function: int gnutls_privkey_import_url (gnutls_privkey_t KEY, const
          char * URL, unsigned int FLAGS)
     KEY: A key of type 'gnutls_privkey_t'

     URL: A PKCS 11 url

     FLAGS: should be zero

     This function will import a PKCS11 or TPM URL as a private key.
     The supported URL types can be checked using
     'gnutls_url_is_supported()' .

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

'INT *note gnutls_privkey_get_pk_algorithm:: (gnutls_privkey_t KEY, unsigned int * BITS)'
'GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_TYPE_T *note gnutls_privkey_get_type:: (gnutls_privkey_t KEY)'
'INT *note gnutls_privkey_status:: (gnutls_privkey_t KEY)'

In order to support cryptographic operations using an external API, the
following function is provided.  This allows for a simple extensibility
API without resorting to PKCS #11.

 -- Function: int gnutls_privkey_import_ext2 (gnutls_privkey_t PKEY,
          gnutls_pk_algorithm_t PK, void * USERDATA,
          gnutls_privkey_sign_func SIGN_FUNC,
          gnutls_privkey_decrypt_func DECRYPT_FUNC,
          gnutls_privkey_deinit_func DEINIT_FUNC, unsigned int FLAGS)
     PKEY: The private key

     PK: The public key algorithm

     USERDATA: private data to be provided to the callbacks

     SIGN_FUNC: callback for signature operations

     DECRYPT_FUNC: callback for decryption operations

     DEINIT_FUNC: a deinitialization function

     FLAGS: Flags for the import

     This function will associate the given callbacks with the
     'gnutls_privkey_t' structure.  At least one of the two callbacks
     must be non-null.  If a deinitialization function is provided then
     flags is assumed to contain 'GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_IMPORT_AUTO_RELEASE' .

     Note that the signing function is supposed to "raw" sign data,
     i.e., without any hashing or preprocessing.  In case of RSA the
     DigestInfo will be provided, and the signing function is expected
     to do the PKCS '1' 1.5 padding and the exponentiation.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1

     parameters from the public key.  Note that unlike
     'gnutls_privkey_sign_hash()' , this function accepts a signature
     algorithm instead of a digest algorithm.  You can use
     'gnutls_pk_to_sign()' to get the appropriate value.

     SIGNATURE: will contain the signature allocate with
     'gnutls_malloc()'

     This function will sign the given data using a signature algorithm
     supported by the private key.  Signature algorithms are always used
     together with a hash functions.  Different hash functions may be
     used for the RSA algorithm, but only the SHA family for the DSA
     keys.

     You may use 'gnutls_pubkey_get_preferred_hash_algorithm()' to
     determine the hash algorithm.

     functions may be used for the RSA algorithm, but only SHA-XXX for
     the DSA keys.

     You may use 'gnutls_pubkey_get_preferred_hash_algorithm()' to
     determine the hash algorithm.

     Note that if 'GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_SIGN_FLAG_TLS1_RSA' flag is specified
     this function will ignore 'hash_algo' and perform a raw PKCS1
     signature.

5.2 Smart cards and HSMs
========================

In this section we present the smart-card and hardware security module
(HSM) support in GnuTLS using PKCS #11 [_PKCS11_].  Hardware security
modules and smart cards provide a way to store private keys and perform
operations on them without exposing them.  This decouples cryptographic
keys from the applications that use them and provide an additional
security layer against cryptographic key extraction.  Since this can
also be achieved in software components such as in Gnome keyring, we
will use the term security module to describe any cryptographic key
separation subsystem.

PKCS #11 is plugin API allowing applications to access cryptographic
operations on a security module, as well as to objects residing on it.
PKCS #11 modules exist for hardware tokens such as smart cards(1),
cryptographic tokens, as well as for software modules like Gnome
Keyring.  The objects residing on a security module may be certificates,
public keys, private keys or secret keys.  Of those certificates and
public/private key pairs can be used with GnuTLS.  PKCS #11's main
advantage is that it allows operations on private key objects such as
decryption and signing without exposing the key.  In GnuTLS the PKCS #11
functionality is available in 'gnutls/pkcs11.h'.

Moreover PKCS #11 can be (ab)used to allow all applications in the same
operating system to access shared cryptographic keys and certificates in
a uniform way, as in *note Figure 5.1: fig-pkcs11-vision.  That way
applications could load their trusted certificate list, as well as user
certificates from a common PKCS #11 module.  Such a provider is the
p11-kit trust storage module(2).

File: gnutls.info,  Node: PKCS11 Initialization,  Next: Accessing objects that require a PIN,  Up: Smart cards and HSMs

5.2.1 Initialization
--------------------

To allow all GnuTLS applications to transparently access smard cards and
tokens, PKCS #11 is automatically initialized during the global
initialization (see *note gnutls_global_init::).  The initialization
function, to select which modules to load reads certain module
configuration files.  Those are stored in '/etc/pkcs11/modules/' and are
the configuration files of p11-kit(1).  For example a file that will
load the OpenSC module, could be named
'/etc/pkcs11/modules/opensc.module' and contain the following:

     module: /usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so

If you use these configuration files, then there is no need for other
initialization in GnuTLS, except for the PIN and token functions (see
next section).  In several cases, however, it is desirable to limit
badly behaving modules (e.g., modules that add an unacceptable delay on
initialization) to single applications.  That can be done using the
"enable-in:" option followed by the base name of applications that this
module should be used.

In all cases, you can also manually initialize the PKCS #11 subsystem if
the default settings are not desirable.  To completely disable PKCS #11
support you need to call *note gnutls_pkcs11_init:: with the flag
'GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_MANUAL' prior to *note gnutls_global_init::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_pkcs11_init (unsigned int FLAGS, const char *
          DEPRECATED_CONFIG_FILE)
     FLAGS: An ORed sequence of 'GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_' *

     DEPRECATED_CONFIG_FILE: either NULL or the location of a deprecated
     configuration file

     This function will initialize the PKCS 11 subsystem in gnutls.  It
     will read configuration files if 'GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_AUTO' is used
     or allow you to independently load PKCS 11 modules using
     'gnutls_pkcs11_add_provider()' if 'GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_MANUAL' is
     specified.

     Normally you don't need to call this function since it is being
     called when the first PKCS 11 operation is requested using the
     'GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_AUTO' flag.  If another flags are required then
     it must be called independently prior to any PKCS 11 operation.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 2.12.0

Note that PKCS #11 modules must be reinitialized on the child processes
after a 'fork'.  In older versions of GnuTLS it was required to call
*note gnutls_pkcs11_reinit::; since 3.3.0 this is no longer required, as
reinitialization occurs automatically.

5.2.2 Accessing objects that require a PIN
------------------------------------------

Objects stored in token such as a private keys are typically protected
from access by a PIN or password.  This PIN may be required to either
read the object (if allowed) or to perform operations with it.  To allow
obtaining the PIN when accessing a protected object, as well as probe
the user to insert the token the following functions allow to set a
callback.

'VOID *note gnutls_pkcs11_set_token_function:: (gnutls_pkcs11_token_callback_t FN, void * USERDATA)'
'VOID *note gnutls_pkcs11_set_pin_function:: (gnutls_pin_callback_t FN, void * USERDATA)'
'INT *note gnutls_pkcs11_add_provider:: (const char * NAME, const char * PARAMS)'
'GNUTLS_PIN_CALLBACK_T *note gnutls_pkcs11_get_pin_function:: (void ** USERDATA)'

The callback is of type 'gnutls_pin_callback_t' and will have as input
the provided userdata, the PIN attempt number, a URL describing the
token, a label describing the object and flags.  The PIN must be at most
of 'pin_max' size and must be copied to pin variable.  The function must
return 0 on success or a negative error code otherwise.

typedef int (*gnutls_pin_callback_t) (void *userdata, int attempt,
                                      const char *token_url,
                                      const char *token_label,
                                      unsigned int flags,
                                      char *pin, size_t pin_max);

The flags are of 'gnutls_pin_flag_t' type and are explained below.

'GNUTLS_PIN_USER'
     The PIN for the user.
'GNUTLS_PIN_SO'
     The PIN for the security officer (admin).
'GNUTLS_PIN_FINAL_TRY'
     This is the final try before blocking.
'GNUTLS_PIN_COUNT_LOW'
     Few tries remain before token blocks.
'GNUTLS_PIN_CONTEXT_SPECIFIC'
     The PIN is for a specific action and key like signing.
'GNUTLS_PIN_WRONG'
     Last given PIN was not correct.

Figure 5.2: The 'gnutls_pin_flag_t' enumeration.

Note that due to limitations of PKCS #11 there are issues when multiple
libraries are sharing a module.  To avoid this problem GnuTLS uses
p11-kit that provides a middleware to control access to resources over

5.2.3 Reading objects
---------------------

All PKCS #11 objects are referenced by GnuTLS functions by URLs as
described in [_PKCS11URI_]. This allows for a consistent naming of
objects across systems and applications in the same system.  For example
a public key on a smart card may be referenced as:

     pkcs11:token=Nikos;serial=307521161601031;model=PKCS%2315; \
     manufacturer=EnterSafe;object=test1;objecttype=public;\
     id=32f153f3e37990b08624141077ca5dec2d15faed

while the smart card itself can be referenced as:
     pkcs11:token=Nikos;serial=307521161601031;model=PKCS%2315;manufacturer=EnterSafe

Objects stored in a PKCS #11 token can be extracted if they are not
marked as sensitive.  Usually only private keys are marked as sensitive
and cannot be extracted, while certificates and other data can be
retrieved.  The functions that can be used to access objects are shown
below.

'INT *note gnutls_pkcs11_obj_import_url:: (gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t OBJ, const char * URL, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_pkcs11_obj_export_url:: (gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t OBJ, gnutls_pkcs11_url_type_t DETAILED, char ** URL)'

 -- Function: int gnutls_pkcs11_obj_get_info (gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t OBJ,
          gnutls_pkcs11_obj_info_t ITYPE, void * OUTPUT, size_t *
          OUTPUT_SIZE)
     OBJ: should contain a 'gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t' structure

     ITYPE: Denotes the type of information requested

     OUTPUT: where output will be stored

     OUTPUT_SIZE: contains the maximum size of the output and will be
     overwritten with actual

     This function will return information about the PKCS11 certificate
     such as the label, id as well as token information where the key is
     stored.  When output is text it returns null terminated string
     although 'output_size' contains the size of the actual data only.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) on success or a negative error
     code on error.

     *Since:* 2.12.0

'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_import_pkcs11:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT, gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t PKCS11_CRT)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_import_pkcs11_url:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT, const char * URL, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_x509_crt_list_import_pkcs11:: (gnutls_x509_crt_t * CERTS, unsigned int CERT_MAX, gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t * const OBJS, unsigned int FLAGS)'

Properties of the physical token can also be accessed and altered with
GnuTLS.  For example data in a token can be erased (initialized), PIN
can be altered, etc.

'INT *note gnutls_pkcs11_token_init:: (const char * TOKEN_URL, const char * SO_PIN, const char * LABEL)'
'INT *note gnutls_pkcs11_token_get_url:: (unsigned int SEQ, gnutls_pkcs11_url_type_t DETAILED, char ** URL)'
'INT *note gnutls_pkcs11_token_get_info:: (const char * URL, gnutls_pkcs11_token_info_t TTYPE, void * OUTPUT, size_t * OUTPUT_SIZE)'
'INT *note gnutls_pkcs11_token_get_flags:: (const char * URL, unsigned int * FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_pkcs11_token_set_pin:: (const char * TOKEN_URL, const char * OLDPIN, const char * NEWPIN, unsigned int FLAGS)'

The following examples demonstrate the usage of the API. The first
example will list all available PKCS #11 tokens in a system and the
latter will list all certificates in a token that have a corresponding
private key.

     int i;
     char* url;

     gnutls_global_init();

     for (i=0;;i++)
       {
         ret = gnutls_pkcs11_token_get_url(i, &url);
         if (ret == GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE)
           break;

         if (ret < 0)
           exit(1);

         fprintf(stdout, "Token[%d]: URL: %s\n", i, url);
         gnutls_free(url);
       }
     gnutls_global_deinit();

5.2.4 Writing objects
---------------------

With GnuTLS you can copy existing private keys and certificates to a
token.  Note that when copying private keys it is recommended to mark
them as sensitive using the 'GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_SENSITIVE' to
prevent its extraction.  An object can be marked as private using the
flag 'GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_PRIVATE', to require PIN to be entered
before accessing the object (for operations or otherwise).

 -- Function: int gnutls_pkcs11_copy_x509_privkey (const char *
          TOKEN_URL, gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY, const char * LABEL,
          unsigned int KEY_USAGE, unsigned int FLAGS)
     TOKEN_URL: A PKCS '11' URL specifying a token

     KEY: A private key

     LABEL: A name to be used for the stored data

     KEY_USAGE: One of GNUTLS_KEY_*

     FLAGS: One of GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_* flags

     This function will copy a private key into a PKCS '11' token
     specified by a URL. It is highly recommended flags to contain
     'GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_SENSITIVE' unless there is a strong
     reason not to.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 2.12.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_pkcs11_copy_x509_crt (const char * TOKEN_URL,
          gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT, const char * LABEL, unsigned int FLAGS)
     TOKEN_URL: A PKCS '11' URL specifying a token

     CRT: A certificate

     LABEL: A name to be used for the stored data

     FLAGS: One of GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_*

     This function will copy a certificate into a PKCS '11' token
     specified by a URL. The certificate can be marked as trusted or
     not.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 2.12.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_pkcs11_delete_url (const char * OBJECT_URL,
          unsigned int FLAGS)
     OBJECT_URL: The URL of the object to delete.

     FLAGS: One of GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_* flags

     This function will delete objects matching the given URL. Note that
     not all tokens support the delete operation.

     *Returns:* On success, the number of objects deleted is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 2.12.0

5.2.5 Using a PKCS #11 token with TLS
-------------------------------------

It is possible to use a PKCS #11 token to a TLS session, as shown in
*note ex-pkcs11-client::.  In addition the following functions can be
used to load PKCS #11 key and certificates by specifying a PKCS #11 URL
instead of a filename.

'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, const char * CAFILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE)'
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const char * CERTFILE, const char * KEYFILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE, const char * PASS, unsigned int FLAGS)'

 -- Function: int gnutls_certificate_set_x509_system_trust
          (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED)
     CRED: is a 'gnutls_certificate_credentials_t' structure.

     This function adds the system's default trusted CAs in order to
     verify client or server certificates.

     In the case the system is currently unsupported
     'GNUTLS_E_UNIMPLEMENTED_FEATURE' is returned.

     *Returns:* the number of certificates processed or a negative error
     code on error.

     *Since:* 3.0.20

5.2.6 Invoking p11tool
----------------------

Program that allows operations on PKCS #11 smart cards and security
modules.

To use PKCS #11 tokens with GnuTLS the p11-kit configuration files need
to be setup.  That is create a .module file in /etc/pkcs11/modules with
the contents 'module: /path/to/pkcs11.so'.  Alternatively the
configuration file /etc/gnutls/pkcs11.conf has to exist and contain a
number of lines of the form 'load=/usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so'.

You can provide the PIN to be used for the PKCS #11 operations with the
environment variables GNUTLS_PIN and GNUTLS_SO_PIN.

This section was generated by *AutoGen*, using the 'agtexi-cmd' template
and the option descriptions for the 'p11tool' program.  This software is
released under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later.

5.2.7 p11tool help/usage ('--help')
-----------------------------------

This is the automatically generated usage text for p11tool.

The text printed is the same whether selected with the 'help' option
('--help') or the 'more-help' option ('--more-help').  'more-help' will
print the usage text by passing it through a pager program.  'more-help'
is disabled on platforms without a working 'fork(2)' function.  The
'PAGER' environment variable is used to select the program, defaulting
to 'more'.  Both will exit with a status code of 0.

               --outfile MyNewKey.pub "pkcs11:TOKEN-URL"
The bits parameter in the above example is explicitly set because some
tokens only support limited choices in the bit length.  The output file
is the corresponding public key.  This key can be used to general a
certificate request with certtool.
     certtool --generate-request --load-privkey "pkcs11:KEY-URL" \
        --load-pubkey MyNewKey.pub --outfile request.pem

5.3 Trusted Platform Module (TPM)
=================================

In this section we present the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) support in
GnuTLS.

There was a big hype when the TPM chip was introduced into computers.
Briefly it is a co-processor in your PC that allows it to perform
calculations independently of the main processor.  This has good and bad
side-effects.  In this section we focus on the good ones; these are the
fact that you can use the TPM chip to perform cryptographic operations
on keys stored in it, without accessing them.  That is very similar to
the operation of a PKCS #11 smart card.  The chip allows for storage and
usage of RSA keys, but has quite some operational differences from PKCS
#11 module, and thus require different handling.  The basic TPM
operations supported and used by GnuTLS, are key generation and signing.

The next sections assume that the TPM chip in the system is already
initialized and in a operational state.

In GnuTLS the TPM functionality is available in 'gnutls/tpm.h'.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Keys in TPM,  Next: Key generation,  Up: Trusted Platform Module

5.3.1 Keys in TPM
-----------------

The RSA keys in the TPM module may either be stored in a flash memory
within TPM or stored in a file in disk.  In the former case the key can
provide operations as with PKCS #11 and is identified by a URL. The URL
is described in [_TPMURI_] and is of the following form.
tpmkey:uuid=42309df8-d101-11e1-a89a-97bb33c23ad1;storage=user

It consists from a unique identifier of the key as well as the part of
the flash memory the key is stored at.  The two options for the storage
field are 'user' and 'system'.  The user keys are typically only
available to the generating user and the system keys to all users.  The
stored in TPM keys are called registered keys.

The keys that are stored in the disk are exported from the TPM but in an
encrypted form.  To access them two passwords are required.  The first
is the TPM Storage Root Key (SRK), and the other is a key-specific
password.  Also those keys are identified by a URL of the form:
tpmkey:file=/path/to/file

When objects require a PIN to be accessed the same callbacks as with
PKCS #11 objects are expected (see *note Accessing objects that require
a PIN::).  Note that the PIN function may be called multiple times to
unlock the SRK and the specific key in use.  The label in the key
function will then be set to 'SRK' when unlocking the SRK key, or to
'TPM' when unlocking any other key.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Key generation,  Next: Using keys,  Prev: Keys in TPM,  Up: Trusted Platform Module

5.3.2 Key generation
--------------------

All keys used by the TPM must be generated by the TPM. This can be done
using *note gnutls_tpm_privkey_generate::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_tpm_privkey_generate (gnutls_pk_algorithm_t PK,
          unsigned int BITS, const char * SRK_PASSWORD, const char *
          KEY_PASSWORD, gnutls_tpmkey_fmt_t FORMAT,
          gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t PUB_FORMAT, gnutls_datum_t * PRIVKEY,
          gnutls_datum_t * PUBKEY, unsigned int FLAGS)
     PK: the public key algorithm

     BITS: the security bits

     SRK_PASSWORD: a password to protect the exported key (optional)

     KEY_PASSWORD: the password for the TPM (optional)

     FORMAT: the format of the private key

     PUB_FORMAT: the format of the public key

     PRIVKEY: the generated key

     PUBKEY: the corresponding public key (may be null)

     FLAGS: should be a list of GNUTLS_TPM_* flags

     This function will generate a private key in the TPM chip.  The
     private key will be generated within the chip and will be exported
     in a wrapped with TPM's master key form.  Furthermore the wrapped
     key can be protected with the provided 'password' .

     Note that bits in TPM is quantized value.  If the input value is
     not one of the allowed values, then it will be quantized to one of
     512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192 and 16384.

     Allowed flags are:

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

'INT *note gnutls_tpm_get_registered:: (gnutls_tpm_key_list_t * LIST)'
'VOID *note gnutls_tpm_key_list_deinit:: (gnutls_tpm_key_list_t LIST)'
'INT *note gnutls_tpm_key_list_get_url:: (gnutls_tpm_key_list_t LIST, unsigned int IDX, char ** URL, unsigned int FLAGS)'

 -- Function: int gnutls_tpm_privkey_delete (const char * URL, const
          char * SRK_PASSWORD)
     URL: the URL describing the key

     SRK_PASSWORD: a password for the SRK key

     This function will unregister the private key from the TPM chip.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

5.3.3 Using keys
----------------

Importing keys
..............

The TPM keys can be used directly by the abstract key types and do not
require any special structures.  Moreover functions like *note
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2:: can access TPM URLs.

'INT *note gnutls_privkey_import_tpm_raw:: (gnutls_privkey_t PKEY, const gnutls_datum_t * FDATA, gnutls_tpmkey_fmt_t FORMAT, const char * SRK_PASSWORD, const char * KEY_PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_pubkey_import_tpm_raw:: (gnutls_pubkey_t PKEY, const gnutls_datum_t * FDATA, gnutls_tpmkey_fmt_t FORMAT, const char * SRK_PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS)'

 -- Function: int gnutls_privkey_import_tpm_url (gnutls_privkey_t PKEY,
          const char * URL, const char * SRK_PASSWORD, const char *
          KEY_PASSWORD, unsigned int FLAGS)
     PKEY: The private key

     URL: The URL of the TPM key to be imported

     SRK_PASSWORD: The password for the SRK key (optional)

     KEY_PASSWORD: A password for the key (optional)

     FLAGS: One of the GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_* flags

     This function will import the given private key to the abstract
     'gnutls_privkey_t' structure.

     Note that unless 'GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_DISABLE_CALLBACKS' is specified,
     if incorrect (or NULL) passwords are given the PKCS11 callback
     functions will be used to obtain the correct passwords.  Otherwise
     if the SRK password is wrong 'GNUTLS_E_TPM_SRK_PASSWORD_ERROR' is
     returned and if the key password is wrong or not provided then
     'GNUTLS_E_TPM_KEY_PASSWORD_ERROR' is returned.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

 -- Function: int gnutls_pubkey_import_tpm_url (gnutls_pubkey_t PKEY,
          const char * URL, const char * SRK_PASSWORD, unsigned int
          FLAGS)
     PKEY: The public key

     URL: The URL of the TPM key to be imported

     SRK_PASSWORD: The password for the SRK key (optional)

     FLAGS: should be zero

     This function will import the given private key to the abstract
     'gnutls_privkey_t' structure.

     Note that unless 'GNUTLS_PUBKEY_DISABLE_CALLBACKS' is specified, if
     incorrect (or NULL) passwords are given the PKCS11 callback
     functions will be used to obtain the correct passwords.  Otherwise
     if the SRK password is wrong 'GNUTLS_E_TPM_SRK_PASSWORD_ERROR' is
     returned.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

Listing and deleting keys
.........................

The registered keys (that are stored in the TPM) can be listed using one
of the following functions.  Those keys are unfortunately only
identified by their UUID and have no label or other human friendly
identifier.  Keys can be deleted from permament storage using *note
gnutls_tpm_privkey_delete::.

'INT *note gnutls_tpm_get_registered:: (gnutls_tpm_key_list_t * LIST)'
'VOID *note gnutls_tpm_key_list_deinit:: (gnutls_tpm_key_list_t LIST)'
'INT *note gnutls_tpm_key_list_get_url:: (gnutls_tpm_key_list_t LIST, unsigned int IDX, char ** URL, unsigned int FLAGS)'

 -- Function: int gnutls_tpm_privkey_delete (const char * URL, const
          char * SRK_PASSWORD)
     URL: the URL describing the key

     SRK_PASSWORD: a password for the SRK key

     This function will unregister the private key from the TPM chip.

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error value.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

and the option descriptions for the 'tpmtool' program.  This software is
released under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later.

5.3.5 tpmtool help/usage ('--help')
-----------------------------------

This is the automatically generated usage text for tpmtool.

The text printed is the same whether selected with the 'help' option
('--help') or the 'more-help' option ('--more-help').  'more-help' will
print the usage text by passing it through a pager program.  'more-help'
is disabled on platforms without a working 'fork(2)' function.  The
'PAGER' environment variable is used to select the program, defaulting
to 'more'.  Both will exit with a status code of 0.

     tpmtool is unavailable - no --help

5.3.6 debug option (-d)
-----------------------

This is the "enable debugging" option.  This option takes a number
argument.  Specifies the debug level.

-----------------------

This is the "specify the security level [low, legacy, medium, high,
ultra]."  option.  This option takes a string argument 'Security
parameter'.  This is alternative to the bits option.  Note however that
the values allowed by the TPM chip are quantized and given values may be
rounded up.

5.3.11 inder option
-------------------

This is the "use the der format for keys."  option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * can be disabled with -no-inder.

The input files will be assumed to be in the portable DER format of TPM.
The default format is a custom format used by various TPM tools

5.3.12 outder option
--------------------

This is the "use der format for output keys" option.

This option has some usage constraints.  It:
   * can be disabled with -no-outder.

The output will be in the TPM portable DER format.

5.3.13 tpmtool exit status
--------------------------

One of the following exit values will be returned:
'0 (EXIT_SUCCESS)'
     Successful program execution.
'1 (EXIT_FAILURE)'
     The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.

5.3.14 tpmtool See Also

6.1 Introduction
================

This chapter tries to explain the basic functionality of the current
GnuTLS library.  Note that there may be additional functionality not
discussed here but included in the library.  Checking the header files
in '/usr/include/gnutls/' and the manpages is recommended.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: General idea,  Next: Error handling,  Up: Introduction to the library

6.1.1 General idea
------------------

A brief description of how GnuTLS sessions operate is shown at *note
Figure 6.1: fig-gnutls-design.  This section will become more clear when
it is completely read.  As shown in the figure, there is a read-only
global state that is initialized once by the global initialization
function.  This global structure, among others, contains the memory
allocation functions used, structures needed for the ASN.1 parser and
depending on the system's CPU, pointers to hardware accelerated
encryption functions.  This structure is never modified by any GnuTLS
function, except for the deinitialization function which frees all
allocated memory and must be called after the program has permanently
finished using GnuTLS.

 [image src="gnutls-internals.png" ]

Figure 6.1: High level design of GnuTLS.

The credentials structures are used by the authentication methods, such
as certificate authentication.  They store certificates, privates keys,
and other information that is needed to prove the identity to the peer,
and/or verify the indentity of the peer.  The information stored in the
credentials structures is initialized once and then can be shared by
many TLS sessions.

A GnuTLS session contains all the required information to handle one
secure connection.  The session communicates with the peers using the
provided functions of the transport layer.  Every session has a unique
session ID shared with the peer.

Since TLS sessions can be resumed, servers need a database back-end to
hold the session's parameters.  Every GnuTLS session after a successful
handshake calls the appropriate back-end function (see *note resume::)
to store the newly negotiated session.  The session database is examined
by the server just after having received the client hello(1), and if the
session ID sent by the client, matches a stored session, the stored
session will be retrieved, and the new session will be a resumed one,
and will share the same session ID with the previous one.

File: gnutls.info,  Node: Error handling,  Next: Common types,  Prev: General idea,  Up: Introduction to the library

6.1.2 Error handling
--------------------

In GnuTLS most functions return an integer type as a result.  In almost
all cases a zero or a positive number means success, and a negative
number indicates failure, or a situation that some action has to be
taken.  Thus negative error codes may be fatal or not.

Fatal errors terminate the connection immediately and further sends and
receives will be disallowed.  Such an example is
'GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED'.  Non-fatal errors may warn about
something, i.e., a warning alert was received, or indicate the some
action has to be taken.  This is the case with the error code
'GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE' returned by *note gnutls_record_recv::.  This
error code indicates that the server requests a re-handshake.  The
client may ignore this request, or may reply with an alert.  You can
test if an error code is a fatal one by using the *note
gnutls_error_is_fatal::.  All errors can be converted to a descriptive
string using *note gnutls_strerror::.

If any non fatal errors, that require an action, are to be returned by a
function, these error codes will be documented in the function's
reference.  For example the error codes
'GNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED' and 'GNUTLS_E_FATAL_ALERT_RECEIVED'
that may returned when receiving data, should be handled by notifying
the user of the alert (as explained in *note Handling alerts::).  See
*note Error codes::, for a description of the available error codes.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Common types,  Next: Debugging and auditing,  Prev: Error handling,  Up: Introduction to the library

6.1.3 Common types
------------------

All strings that are to provided as input to GnuTLS functions should be
in UTF-8 unless otherwise specified.  Output strings are also in UTF-8
format unless otherwise specified.

When data of a fixed size are provided to GnuTLS functions then the
helper structure 'gnutls_datum_t' is often used.  Its definition is
shown below.
  typedef struct
  {
    unsigned char *data;
    unsigned int size;
  } gnutls_datum_t;

Other functions that require data for scattered read use a structure
similar to 'struct iovec' typically used by 'readv'.  It is shown below.
  typedef struct
  {
    void *iov_base;             /* Starting address */
    size_t iov_len;             /* Number of bytes to transfer */
  } giovec_t;

6.1.4 Debugging and auditing
----------------------------

In many cases things may not go as expected and further information, to
assist debugging, from GnuTLS is desired.  Those are the cases where the
*note gnutls_global_set_log_level:: and *note
gnutls_global_set_log_function:: are to be used.  Those will print
verbose information on the GnuTLS functions internal flow.

'VOID *note gnutls_global_set_log_level:: (int LEVEL)'
'VOID *note gnutls_global_set_log_function:: (gnutls_log_func LOG_FUNC)'

Alternatively the environment variable 'GNUTLS_DEBUG_LEVEL' can be set
to a logging level and GnuTLS will output debugging output to standard
error.  Other available environment variables are shown in *note Table
6.1: tab:environment.

Variable               Purpose
                       
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
'GNUTLS_DEBUG_LEVEL'   When set to a numeric value, it sets the default
                       debugging level for GnuTLS applications.
                       
'GNUTLS_CPUID_OVERRIDE'That environment variable can be used to
                       explicitly enable/disable the use of certain CPU
                       capabilities.  Note that CPU detection cannot be
                       overriden, i.e., VIA options cannot be enabled
                       on an Intel CPU. The currently available options
                       are:
                          * 0x1: Disable all run-time detected
                            optimizations
                          * 0x2: Enable AES-NI
                          * 0x4: Enable SSSE3
                          * 0x8: Enable PCLMUL
                          * 0x100000: Enable VIA padlock

When debugging is not required, important issues, such as detected
attacks on the protocol still need to be logged.  This is provided by
the logging function set by *note
gnutls_global_set_audit_log_function::.  The provided function will
receive an message and the corresponding TLS session.  The session
information might be used to derive IP addresses or other information
about the peer involved.

 -- Function: void gnutls_global_set_audit_log_function
          (gnutls_audit_log_func LOG_FUNC)
     LOG_FUNC: it is the audit log function

     This is the function to set the audit logging function.  This is a
     function to report important issues, such as possible attacks in
     the protocol.  This is different from
     'gnutls_global_set_log_function()' because it will report also
     session-specific events.  The session parameter will be null if
     there is no corresponding TLS session.

     'gnutls_audit_log_func' is of the form, void
     (*gnutls_audit_log_func)( gnutls_session_t, const char*);

6.1.5 Thread safety
-------------------

The GnuTLS library is thread safe by design, meaning that objects of the
library such as TLS sessions, can be safely divided across threads as
long as a single thread accesses a single object.  This is sufficient to
support a server which handles several sessions per thread.  If,
however, an object needs to be shared across threads then access must be
protected with a mutex.  Read-only access to objects, for example the
credentials holding structures, is also thread-safe.

The random generator of the cryptographic back-end, utilizes mutex locks
(e.g., pthreads on GNU/Linux and CriticalSection on Windows) which are
setup by GnuTLS on library initialization.  Prior to version 3.3.0 they
were setup by calling *note gnutls_global_init::.  On special systems
you could manually specify the locking system using the function *note
gnutls_global_set_mutex:: before calling any other GnuTLS function.
Setting mutexes manually is not recommended.  An example of non-native
thread usage is shown below.

     #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

     int main()
     {
        /* When the system mutexes are not to be used
         * gnutls_global_set_mutex() must be called explicitly
         */
        gnutls_global_set_mutex (mutex_init, mutex_deinit,
                                 mutex_lock, mutex_unlock);
     }

 -- Function: void gnutls_global_set_mutex (mutex_init_func INIT,
          mutex_deinit_func DEINIT, mutex_lock_func LOCK,
          mutex_unlock_func UNLOCK)
     INIT: mutex initialization function

     DEINIT: mutex deinitialization function

     LOCK: mutex locking function

     UNLOCK: mutex unlocking function

     With this function you are allowed to override the default mutex
     locks used in some parts of gnutls and dependent libraries.  This
     function should be used if you have complete control of your
     program and libraries.  Do not call this function from a library,
     or preferrably from any application unless really needed to.
     GnuTLS will use the appropriate locks for the running system.

     This function must be called prior to any other gnutls function.

     *Since:* 2.12.0


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Callback functions,  Prev: Thread safety,  Up: Introduction to the library

6.1.6 Callback functions
------------------------

There are several cases where GnuTLS may need out of band input from
your program.  This is now implemented using some callback functions,
which your program is expected to register.

An example of this type of functions are the push and pull callbacks
which are used to specify the functions that will retrieve and send data
to the transport layer.

'VOID *note gnutls_transport_set_push_function:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_push_func PUSH_FUNC)'
'VOID *note gnutls_transport_set_pull_function:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_pull_func PULL_FUNC)'

Other callback functions may require more complicated input and data to
be allocated.  Such an example is *note
gnutls_srp_set_server_credentials_function::.  All callbacks should
allocate and free memory using 'gnutls_malloc' and 'gnutls_free'.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Preparation,  Next: Session initialization,  Prev: Introduction to the library,  Up: How to use GnuTLS in applications

6.2 Preparation
===============

To use GnuTLS, you have to perform some changes to your sources and your
build system.  The necessary changes are explained in the following
subsections.

* Menu:

* Headers::
* Initialization::
* Version check::
* Building the source::


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Headers,  Next: Initialization,  Up: Preparation

6.2.1 Headers
-------------

All the data types and functions of the GnuTLS library are defined in
the header file 'gnutls/gnutls.h'.  This must be included in all
programs that make use of the GnuTLS library.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Initialization,  Next: Version check,  Prev: Headers,  Up: Preparation

6.2.2 Initialization
--------------------

GnuTLS must be initialized before it can be used.  The library is
initialized on load; prior to 3.3.0 was initialized by calling *note
gnutls_global_init::.  The initialization typically enables CPU-specific
acceleration, performs any required precalculations needed, opens any
required system devices (e.g., /dev/urandom on Linux) and initializes
subsystems that could be used later.

The resources allocated by the initialization process will be released
on library deinitialization, or explictly by calling *note
gnutls_global_deinit::.


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Version check,  Next: Building the source,  Prev: Initialization,  Up: Preparation

6.2.3 Version check
-------------------

It is often desirable to check that the version of 'gnutls' used is
indeed one which fits all requirements.  Even with binary compatibility
new features may have been introduced but due to problem with the
dynamic linker an old version is actually used.  So you may want to
check that the version is okay right after program start-up.  See the
function *note gnutls_check_version::.

On the other hand, it is often desirable to support more than one
versions of the library.  In that case you could utilize compile-time
feature checks using the the 'GNUTLS_VERSION_NUMBER' macro.  For
example, to conditionally add code for GnuTLS 3.2.1 or later, you may
use:
     #if GNUTLS_VERSION_NUMBER >= 0x030201
      ...
     #endif


File: gnutls.info,  Node: Building the source,  Prev: Version check,  Up: Preparation

6.2.4 Building the source
-------------------------

If you want to compile a source file including the 'gnutls/gnutls.h'
header file, you must make sure that the compiler can find it in the
directory hierarchy.  This is accomplished by adding the path to the
directory in which the header file is located to the compilers include
file search path (via the '-I' option).

However, the path to the include file is determined at the time the
source is configured.  To solve this problem, the library uses the
external package 'pkg-config' that knows the path to the include file
and other configuration options.  The options that need to be added to
the compiler invocation at compile time are output by the '--cflags'
option to 'pkg-config gnutls'.  The following example shows how it can
be used at the command line:

     gcc -c foo.c `pkg-config gnutls --cflags`

Adding the output of 'pkg-config gnutls --cflags' to the compilers
command line will ensure that the compiler can find the
'gnutls/gnutls.h' header file.

A similar problem occurs when linking the program with the library.
Again, the compiler has to find the library files.  For this to work,
the path to the library files has to be added to the library search path
(via the '-L' option).  For this, the option '--libs' to 'pkg-config
gnutls' can be used.  For convenience, this option also outputs all
other options that are required to link the program with the library
(for instance, the '-ltasn1' option).  The example shows how to link
'foo.o' with the library to a program 'foo'.

     gcc -o foo foo.o `pkg-config gnutls --libs`

Of course you can also combine both examples to a single command by
specifying both options to 'pkg-config':

     gcc -o foo foo.c `pkg-config gnutls --cflags --libs`

When a program uses the GNU autoconf system, then the following line or
similar can be used to detect the presence of GnuTLS.

     PKG_CHECK_MODULES([LIBGNUTLS], [gnutls >= 3.3.0])

     AC_SUBST([LIBGNUTLS_CFLAGS])
     AC_SUBST([LIBGNUTLS_LIBS])

6.3 Session initialization
==========================

In the previous sections we have discussed the global initialization
required for GnuTLS as well as the initialization required for each
authentication method's credentials (see *note Authentication::).  In
this section we elaborate on the TLS or DTLS session initiation.  Each
session is initialized using *note gnutls_init:: which among others is
used to specify the type of the connection (server or client), and the
underlying protocol type, i.e., datagram (UDP) or reliable (TCP).

 -- Function: int gnutls_init (gnutls_session_t * SESSION, unsigned int
          FLAGS)
     SESSION: is a pointer to a 'gnutls_session_t' structure.

     FLAGS: indicate if this session is to be used for server or client.

     This function initializes the current session to null.  Every
     session must be initialized before use, so internal structures can
     be allocated.  This function allocates structures which can only be
     free'd by calling 'gnutls_deinit()' .  Returns 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'
     (0) on success.

     'flags' can be one of 'GNUTLS_CLIENT' and 'GNUTLS_SERVER' .  For a
     DTLS entity, the flags 'GNUTLS_DATAGRAM' and 'GNUTLS_NONBLOCK' are
     also available.  The latter flag will enable a non-blocking
     operation of the DTLS timers.

     The flag 'GNUTLS_NO_REPLAY_PROTECTION' will disable any replay
     protection in DTLS mode.  That must only used when replay
     protection is achieved using other means.

     Note that since version 3.1.2 this function enables some common TLS
     extensions such as session tickets and OCSP certificate status
     request in client side by default.  To prevent that use the
     'GNUTLS_NO_EXTENSIONS' flag.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' on success, or an error code.

After the session initialization details on the allowed ciphersuites and
protocol versions should be set using the priority functions such as
*note gnutls_priority_set_direct::.  We elaborate on them in *note
Priority Strings::.  The credentials used for the key exchange method,
such as certificates or usernames and passwords should also be
associated with the session current session using *note
gnutls_credentials_set::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_credentials_set (gnutls_session_t SESSION,
          gnutls_credentials_type_t TYPE, void * CRED)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' structure.

     TYPE: is the type of the credentials

     CRED: is a pointer to a structure.

     Sets the needed credentials for the specified type.  Eg username,
     password - or public and private keys etc.  The 'cred' parameter is
     a structure that depends on the specified type and on the current
     session (client or server).

     In order to minimize memory usage, and share credentials between
     several threads gnutls keeps a pointer to cred, and not the whole
     cred structure.  Thus you will have to keep the structure allocated
     until you call 'gnutls_deinit()' .

     For 'GNUTLS_CRD_ANON' , 'cred' should be
     'gnutls_anon_client_credentials_t' in case of a client.  In case of
     a server it should be 'gnutls_anon_server_credentials_t' .

     For 'GNUTLS_CRD_SRP' , 'cred' should be
     'gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t' in case of a client, and
     'gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t' , in case of a server.

     For 'GNUTLS_CRD_CERTIFICATE' , 'cred' should be
     'gnutls_certificate_credentials_t' .

     *Returns:* On success, 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) is returned,
     otherwise a negative error code is returned.

6.4 Associating the credentials
===============================

* Menu:

* Certificate credentials::
* SRP credentials::
* PSK credentials::
* Anonymous credentials::

Each authentication method is associated with a key exchange method, and
a credentials type.  The contents of the credentials is
method-dependent, e.g.  certificates for certificate authentication and
should be initialized and associated with a session (see *note
gnutls_credentials_set::).  A mapping of the key exchange methods with
the credential types is shown in *note Table 6.2: tab:key-exchange-cred.

6.4.1 Certificates
------------------

Server certificate authentication
.................................

When using certificates the server is required to have at least one
certificate and private key pair.  Clients may not hold such a pair, but
a server could require it.  In this section we discuss general issues
applying to both client and server certificates.  The next section will
elaborate on issues arising from client authentication only.

'INT *note gnutls_certificate_allocate_credentials:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t * RES)'
'VOID *note gnutls_certificate_free_credentials:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t SC)'

After the credentials structures are initialized, the certificate and
key pair must be loaded.  This occurs before any TLS session is
initialized, and the same structures are reused for multiple sessions.
Depending on the certificate type different loading functions are
available, as shown below.  For X.509 certificates, the functions will
accept and use a certificate chain that leads to a trusted authority.
The certificate chain must be ordered in such way that every certificate
certifies the one before it.  The trusted authority's certificate need
not to be included since the peer should possess it already.

'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_mem2:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const gnutls_datum_t * CERT, const gnutls_datum_t * KEY, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE, const char * PASS, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, gnutls_x509_crt_t * CERT_LIST, int CERT_LIST_SIZE, gnutls_x509_privkey_t KEY)'
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const char * CERTFILE, const char * KEYFILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE, const char * PASS, unsigned int FLAGS)'

'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key_mem:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const gnutls_datum_t * CERT, const gnutls_datum_t * KEY, gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t FORMAT)'
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, gnutls_openpgp_crt_t CRT, gnutls_openpgp_privkey_t PKEY)'
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_openpgp_key_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const char * CERTFILE, const char * KEYFILE, gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t FORMAT)'

Note however, that since functions like *note
gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2:: may accept URLs that specify
objects stored in token, another important function is *note
gnutls_certificate_set_pin_function::.  That allows setting a callback
function to retrieve a PIN if the input keys are protected by PIN by the
token.

 -- Function: void gnutls_certificate_set_pin_function
          (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, gnutls_pin_callback_t
          FN, void * USERDATA)
     CRED: is a 'gnutls_certificate_credentials_t' structure.

     FN: A PIN callback

     USERDATA: Data to be passed in the callback

     This function will set a callback function to be used when required
     to access a protected object.  This function overrides any other
     global PIN functions.

     Note that this function must be called right after initialization
     to have effect.

     *Since:* 3.1.0

If the imported keys and certificates need to be accessed before any TLS
session is established, it is convenient to use *note
gnutls_certificate_set_key:: in combination with *note
gnutls_pcert_import_x509_raw:: and *note
gnutls_privkey_import_x509_raw::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_certificate_set_key
          (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t RES, const char ** NAMES,
          int NAMES_SIZE, gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT_LIST, int
          PCERT_LIST_SIZE, gnutls_privkey_t KEY)
     RES: is a 'gnutls_certificate_credentials_t' structure.

     NAMES: is an array of DNS name of the certificate (NULL if none)

     NAMES_SIZE: holds the size of the names list

     PCERT_LIST: contains a certificate list (path) for the specified
     private key

     PCERT_LIST_SIZE: holds the size of the certificate list

     KEY: is a 'gnutls_privkey_t' key

     This function sets a certificate/private key pair in the
     gnutls_certificate_credentials_t structure.  This function may be
     called more than once, in case multiple keys/certificates exist for
     the server.  For clients that wants to send more than its own end
     entity certificate (e.g., also an intermediate CA cert) then put
     the certificate chain in 'pcert_list' .

     Note that the 'pcert_list' and 'key' will become part of the
     credentials structure and must not be deallocated.  They will be
     automatically deallocated when the 'res' structure is
     deinitialized.

     *Returns:* 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS' (0) on success, or a negative error
     code.

     *Since:* 3.0

If multiple certificates are used with the functions above each client's
request will be served with the certificate that matches the requested
name (see *note Server name indication::).

As an alternative to loading from files or buffers, a callback may be
used for the server or the client to specify the certificate and the key
at the handshake time.  In that case a certificate should be selected
according the peer's signature algorithm preferences.  To get those
preferences use *note gnutls_sign_algorithm_get_requested::.  Both
functions are shown below.

'VOID *note gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function * FUNC)'
'VOID *note gnutls_certificate_set_retrieve_function2:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, gnutls_certificate_retrieve_function2 * FUNC)'
'INT *note gnutls_sign_algorithm_get_requested:: (gnutls_session_t SESSION, size_t INDX, gnutls_sign_algorithm_t * ALGO)'
c The functions above do not handle the requested server name
automatically.  A server would need to check the name requested by the
client using *note gnutls_server_name_get::, and serve the appropriate
certificate.  Note that some of these functions require the
'gnutls_pcert_st' structure to be filled in.  Helper functions to fill
in the structure are listed below.

typedef struct gnutls_pcert_st
{
  gnutls_pubkey_t pubkey;
  gnutls_datum_t cert;
  gnutls_certificate_type_t type;
} gnutls_pcert_st;

'INT *note gnutls_pcert_import_x509:: (gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT, gnutls_x509_crt_t CRT, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_pcert_import_openpgp:: (gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT, gnutls_openpgp_crt_t CRT, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_pcert_import_x509_raw:: (gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT, const gnutls_datum_t * CERT, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'INT *note gnutls_pcert_import_openpgp_raw:: (gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT, const gnutls_datum_t * CERT, gnutls_openpgp_crt_fmt_t FORMAT, gnutls_openpgp_keyid_t KEYID, unsigned int FLAGS)'
'VOID *note gnutls_pcert_deinit:: (gnutls_pcert_st * PCERT)'

In a handshake, the negotiated cipher suite depends on the certificate's
parameters, so some key exchange methods might not be available with all
certificates.  GnuTLS will disable ciphersuites that are not compatible
with the key, or the enabled authentication methods.  For example keys
marked as sign-only, will not be able to access the plain RSA
ciphersuites, that require decryption.  It is not recommended to use RSA
keys for both signing and encryption.  If possible use a different key
for the 'DHE-RSA' which uses signing and 'RSA' that requires decryption.
All the key exchange methods shown in *note Table 4.1: tab:key-exchange.
are available in certificate authentication.

Client certificate authentication
.................................

If a certificate is to be requested from the client during the
handshake, the server will send a certificate request message.  This
behavior is controlled *note gnutls_certificate_server_set_request::.
The request contains a list of the acceptable by the server certificate
signers.  This list is constructed using the trusted certificate
authorities of the server.  In cases where the server supports a large
number of certificate authorities it makes sense not to advertise all of
the names to save bandwidth.  That can be controlled using the function
*note gnutls_certificate_send_x509_rdn_sequence::.  This however will
have the side-effect of not restricting the client to certificates
signed by server's acceptable signers.

 -- Function: void gnutls_certificate_server_set_request
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION, gnutls_certificate_request_t REQ)
     SESSION: is a 'gnutls_session_t' structure.

     REQ: is one of GNUTLS_CERT_REQUEST, GNUTLS_CERT_REQUIRE

     This function specifies if we (in case of a server) are going to
     send a certificate request message to the client.  If 'req' is
     GNUTLS_CERT_REQUIRE then the server will return an error if the
     peer does not provide a certificate.  If you do not call this
     function then the client will not be asked to send a certificate.

 -- Function: void gnutls_certificate_send_x509_rdn_sequence
          (gnutls_session_t SESSION, int STATUS)
     SESSION: is a pointer to a 'gnutls_session_t' structure.

     STATUS: is 0 or 1

     If status is non zero, this function will order gnutls not to send
     the rdnSequence in the certificate request message.  That is the
     server will not advertise its trusted CAs to the peer.  If status
     is zero then the default behaviour will take effect, which is to
     advertise the server's trusted CAs.

     This function has no effect in clients, and in authentication
     methods other than certificate with X.509 certificates.

Client or server certificate verification
.........................................

Certificate verification is possible by loading the trusted authorities
into the credentials structure by using the following functions,

'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_system_trust:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED)'
'INT *note gnutls_certificate_set_x509_trust_file:: (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED, const char * CAFILE, gnutls_x509_crt_fmt_t TYPE)'

The peer's certificate is not automatically verified and one must call
*note gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3:: after a successful handshake to
verify the certificate's signature and the owner of the certificate.
The verification status returned can be printed using *note
gnutls_certificate_verification_status_print::.

Alternatively the verification can occur during the handshake by using
*note gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function::.

The functions above provide a brief verification output.  If a detailed
output is required one should call *note gnutls_certificate_get_peers::
to obtain the raw certificate of the peer and verify it using the
functions discussed in *note X.509 certificates::.

 -- Function: int gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3 (gnutls_session_t
          SESSION, const char * HOSTNAME, unsigned int * STATUS)
     SESSION: is a gnutls session

     HOSTNAME: is the expected name of the peer; may be 'NULL'

     STATUS: is the output of the verification

     This function will verify the peer's certificate and store the
     status in the 'status' variable as a bitwise or'd
     gnutls_certificate_status_t values or zero if the certificate is
     trusted.  Note that value in 'status' is set only when the return
     value of this function is success (i.e, failure to trust a
     certificate does not imply a negative return value).  The default
     verification flags used by this function can be overridden using
     'gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags()' .  See the documentation of
     'gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2()' for details in the
     verification process.

     If the 'hostname' provided is non-NULL then this function will
     compare the hostname in the certificate against the given.  The
     comparison will be accurate for ascii names; non-ascii names are
     compared byte-by-byte.  If names do not match the
     'GNUTLS_CERT_UNEXPECTED_OWNER' status flag will be set.

     In order to verify the purpose of the end-certificate (by checking
     the extended key usage), use 'gnutls_certificate_verify_peers()' .

     *Returns:* a negative error code on error and 'GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS'
     (0) on success.

     *Since:* 3.1.4

 -- Function: void gnutls_certificate_set_verify_function
          (gnutls_certificate_credentials_t CRED,
          gnutls_certificate_verify_function * FUNC)
     CRED: is a 'gnutls_certificate_credentials_t' structure.

     FUNC: is the callback function

     This function sets a callback to be called when peer's certificate
     has been received in order to verify it on receipt rather than
     doing after the handshake is completed.

     The callback's function prototype is: int
     (*callback)(gnutls_session_t);

     If the callback function is provided then gnutls will call it, in
     the handshake, just after the certificate message has been
     received.  To verify or obtain the certificate the
     'gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2()' ,
     'gnutls_certificate_type_get()' , 'gnutls_certificate_get_peers()'
     functions can be used.

     The callback function should return 0 for the handshake to continue
     or non-zero to terminate.

     *Since:* 2.10.0

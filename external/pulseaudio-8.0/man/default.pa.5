default.pa \- PulseAudio Sound Server Startup Script
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB\fI~/.config/pulse/default.pa\fB

\fI/etc/pulse/default.pa\fB

\fI/etc/pulse/system.pa\fB
\f1
.SH DESCRIPTION
The PulseAudio sound server interprets a configuration script on startup, which is mainly used to define the set of modules to load. When PulseAudio runs in the per-user mode and \fI~/.config/pulse/default.pa\f1 exists, that file is used. When PulseAudio runs in the per-user mode and that file doesn't exist, \fI/etc/pulse/default.pa\f1 is used. When PulseAudio runs as a system service, \fI/etc/pulse/system.pa\f1 is used.

The script should contain directives in the PulseAudio CLI language, as documented in \fBpulse-cli-syntax(5)\f1.

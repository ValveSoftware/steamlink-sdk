    \section2 Maze in QML
    \brief The Maze example demonstrates the TiltSensor QML type.


    To write a QML application that will use the TiltSensor QML sensors type you need to do the following steps:

    Import the QtSensors 5.x declarative plugin:

    \snippet maze/maze.qml 0

    Add the Sensor QML types into your qml file.

    In this example we use the TiltSensor with values based in degrees and an accuracy of 5 degree:

    \snippet maze/maze.qml 1

    Starting the sensor can be done by setting the 'enabled' property to true:

    \snippet maze/maze.qml 2

    The mouse should move by a factor of the tilt value:

    \snippet maze/maze.qml 3

    The walk direction of the mouse takes into account some collision detection:

    \snippet maze/maze.qml 4

    The rotation of the mouse image is determined according to the angle that the mouse is moving.

    \snippet maze/Mouse.qml 0

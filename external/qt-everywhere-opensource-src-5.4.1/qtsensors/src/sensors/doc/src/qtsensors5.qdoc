    \brief Provides classes for reading sensor data.

    Mobile devices contain sensor hardware that allow detecting changes in various physical
    properties of the device itself or its immediate environment. Examples of device properties
    include the angle at which the device is held, whereas environmental properties include for
    example the current level of ambient light.

    \ingroup qmlmodules

    \brief Provides types for reading sensor data.

    \section1 QML Module API

    If the module is imported into a namespace, some additional methods become available.

    \code
    import QtSensors 5.0
    ...
        Component.onCompleted: {
            var types = QmlSensors.sensorTypes();
            console.log(types.join(", "));
        }
    \endcode

    The documentation for the module API can be found in SensorGlobal.

    \section1 QML Sensor Types

    These types represent specific types of sensors.

    Note that most properties come from the abstract \l{Sensor}{Sensor} element.

    \annotatedlist qml-sensors_type

    \section1 QML Reading Types

    The data from a sensor comes via a reading class.

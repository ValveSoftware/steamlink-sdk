    \title Enginio C++ Examples - Todos
    \example todos-cpp
    \brief The Todo example shows how to use the \l {EnginioModel} with Qt Widgets.
    \ingroup enginio-examples
    \inmodule enginio-qt

    In this example, a list of objects is displayed in a \l QTreeView.
    Each item in the list is a \c {Todo} object, which can be marked
    \c {Done} or \c {Not done}.  A \c {Todo} can be added, removed,
    or altered. We will be using the classes and concepts duscussed in
    \l {Model/View Programming} {Model/View Programming}.

    \image todo-example.png

    In this simple schema, each \c {ToDo} object will have two properties:
    a \c {string} named \c {title} and a \c {bool} named \c {completed}.
    These properties are added to the default properties e.g.: creation date,
    which always exist.

    A \c {Todo} object will look like this in \l {http://json.org} {JSON}:

    \code
{
  "title": "Buy Milk",
  "completed": false
}
    \endcode

    A ToDo object can be created and appended to an EnginioModel using
    \l {EnginioModel::append()} {append()}, as shown in
    \l {mainwindow_appenditem} {MainWindow::appendItem()}. Alternatively,
    if many ToDo objects are to be added to the model all at once, they
    can be inserted directly into the server database via the model's
    \l {EnginioClient} {Enginio client}. The client is obtained from
    the model with \l {EnginioModel::client()} {client()}. Then the
    ToDo objects are inserted into the server database with the client's
    \l {EnginioClient::create()} {create()} function. The model can then
     be reloaded from the server with \l {EnginioModel::reload()} {reload()}.

    But first we must create some infrastructure. Our \c{TodosModel}
    class is declared in \l{todos-cpp/todosmodel.h}. It inherits
    \l[CPP]{EnginioModel}, which is a \l{QAbstractListModel}{list
    model}. We add two roles to the \l {Enginio::Role} {Enginio::Role
    enum}, chosen for the new properties, one for the ToDo \c title
    and one for marking a ToDo as \c{completed}. We assign enum values
    to the new roles, equating \c{TitleRole} to
    \l{Enginio::CustomPropertyRole}, which is itself equated to
    \l{Qt::UserRole} + 10.  \snippet todos-cpp/todosmodel.h definition

    The new roles can be used for displaying and editing the values of
    the new properties. Views of the model also use roles from in
    \l{Qt::ItemDataRole} enum. The example's view is a \l {QTreeView},
    as shown in the \l{todos-cpp/mainwindow.h} {MainWindow class},
    which holds a pointer to the view, a pointer to the
    \l{EnginioClient} {client}, and a pointer to the
    \l{todos-cpp/todosmodel.h} {model}.

    A new \l [CPP] {EnginioModel} is empty. It automatically populates itself
    from the server, when its \l{EnginioModel::query}{query} and
    \l{EnginioModel::client}{client} properties have both been set. In the
    example, these properties are set in the constructor for the
    \l {todos-cpp/mainwindow.cpp} {main window}. The \l {EnginioClient} is
    created first. Then an instance of the \c ToDosModel is created, and its
    client is set using EnginioModel::setClient(). Then the query is created
    as a QJsonObject, and the model's query is set using EnginioModel::setQuery().

    Once the ToDo data has been downloaded, the model resets itself, and sets up
    the internal data cache and roles names. \l [CPP] {EnginioModel} guesses the
    role names based on heuristics. It may be wrong if not all objects received
    from the backend have exactly the same structure. For example, a property can
    be missing in certain objects. To protect against such cases, we overload
    \l{EnginioModel::roleNames()}{roleNames()}.  Overriding
    \l{EnginioModel::roleNames()}{roleNames()} can also be used to
    match default Qt roles to the named ones.

    \snippet todos-cpp/todosmodel.cpp roleNames

    In this example, we map the \l Qt::DisplayRole and \l Qt::EditRole
    to the \c title property in the JSON.  This way the right string
    is shown by default and editing works as expected.

    Remember to always call the base class implementation to avoid
    situations in which the internal cache is not in sync.

    By default \l [CPP] {EnginioModel} operates on \l{QJsonValue}, and
    that is what the \l{EnginioModel::data()}{data()} function returns
    inside the \l QVariant, but standard views, such as \l QListView,
    use predefined roles which do not map directly to our roles.  That
    is why we need to write a mapping between them:

    \snippet todos-cpp/todosmodel.cpp data

    As we have our model defined, we need to create an instance of \l {EnginioClient}:

    \snippet todos-cpp/mainwindow.cpp client

    It is used by the model to connect to the Enginio backend. Next we
    need to construct and configure our model too. The configuration
    is based on two steps, assigning an \l {EnginioClient} instance
    and by creating a query.

    \snippet todos-cpp/mainwindow.cpp model

    The model has to be assigned to a view. In this example it is a
    \l QTreeView.

    \snippet todos-cpp/mainwindow.cpp assignModel

    To make the application fully functional, a way to add and remove
    a Todo is needed.  To do so, we need to connect the correct
    buttons to slots for adding a new item:

    \target mainwindow_appenditem
    \snippet todos-cpp/mainwindow.cpp appendItem

    and for removing it:

    \snippet todos-cpp/mainwindow.cpp removeItem

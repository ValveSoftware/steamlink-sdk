    \title Enginio C++ Examples - Cloud Address Book
    \example cloudaddressbook
    \brief The Cloud Address Book demonstrates how to use sorting, filtering, and the full text search functionality.
    \ingroup enginio-examples
    \inmodule enginio-qt

    This example explains how to use the full text search feature of Enginio, and how to sort and filter data
    showed from the EnginioModel. A simple addressbook-like application will be created to illustrate this.
    This example doesn't cover security or multi-user management. For such topics, please refer to the
    Social Todo example.

    \section1 Preconditions
    To start the example, a \e {backend id} and a \e {backend secret} have to be provided for an existing and configured
    Enginio backend. The backend can be created using the dashboard, where the Cloud Address Book preconfigured backend
    can be chosen.

    \section1 Backend Description
    We recommend to use preconfigured backend, because it contains already all data and structures that are
    needed to run these examples, but it is not difficult to create the backend from scratch too.
    The backend should contain one custom object type \c objects.addressbook having properties:
    \list
        \li firstName
        \li lastName
        \li email
        \li phone
        \li address
    \endlist
    All properties are of \c string type and have to be indexed, because only indexed properties will be searched
    by the full text search.

    \section1 Application Design
    The application's ui mainly consists of a table showing all addresses and a text filed where a query
    can be typed. A user should be able to sort addresses or highlight an address containing a specified phrase.

    \section1 Implementation
    From a developer point of view the application consists of a few simple components:
    \list
        \li \l EnginioClient which encapsulates all information needed to keep the connection to the backend
        \li \l EnginioModel which queries all addresses
        \li \l QSortFilterProxy which sorts the data
        \li \l QTableView which shows the data
    \endlist

    First we need to establish a connection to the Enginio service. We need to specify the \e{backend id} as well
    as \e {backend secret}.

    The second step is to create EnginioModel which queries all data from the backend. The query is quite simple,
    it specifies an object type of which all objects need to be returned.
    \snippet cloudaddressbook/mainwindow.cpp model

    EnginioModel can sort or filter data only initially, which means that, for example, a newly added
    item will not be placed correctly. To solve the problem QSortFilterProxy has to be used.

    Now is a time to look deeper into EngnioModel. EnginioModel should define data roles.
    \snippet cloudaddressbook/addressbookmodel.h Roles
    \snippet cloudaddressbook/addressbookmodel.cpp Roles

    and as always the \l{EnginioModel::data()}{data()} and \l{EnginioModel::setData()}{setData()} functions
    have to be overridden to provide Qt::DisplayRole in such a way as to nicely cooperate with QTableView.
    \snippet cloudaddressbook/addressbookmodel.cpp data

    QTableView requires the specification of columns headers, so that they can be shown in the user interface:
    \snippet cloudaddressbook/addressbookmodel.cpp tableViewIntegration

    Integration of the full text search is the last step in this tutorial. The goal is to highlight items that
    contain a given phrase. The highlighting is done by \l{EnginioModel::data()}{data()}, which returns a bold font
    for Qt::FontRole if an item is matching the search query. For reasons of simplicity, this example assumes that
    the matching items count is not big and can be kept in a QSet, which would be recreated on each search.

    To do a full text search, a JSON query needs to be constructed:

    \snippet cloudaddressbook/addressbookmodel.cpp query

    The query contains \c objectTypes property (note the 's' at the end) which is an array of all object types which
    have to be searched. In this case, it is only one type: \c objects.addressbook. Next the \c search property has to
    be specified. It is an object that is required to have a \c phrase property, containing the phrase to search for.
    phrase that has to be found. Please use the wildcard  \c * in the search criteria, otherwise only full words will
    be found. To avoid substrings, for example in an \c {object id}, which is not visible for a user,
    the search is limited to a selected array of \c {properties}.
    When the search query is constructed, it is enough to call \l{EnginioClient::fullTextSearch()}{fullTextSearch()}:
    \snippet cloudaddressbook/addressbookmodel.cpp callSearch
    The result will be delivered to the \c searchResultsArrived slot. All objects ids found will be gathered in a
    \c markedItems set.

    \title Enginio QML Examples - Users
    \example users
    \brief The Users example introduces user registration, authentication, and browsing.
    \ingroup enginio-qml-examples
    \inmodule enginio-qml

    \section1 Introduction

    This example will demonstrate how to register and authenticate a user, and what kind of information
    is attached to an authenticated session. This is a simple example, and data access rights
    management is not covered here. For such information, please refer to the Social Todo example.

    There is no special need for the backend setup. This example will use only predefined
    structures, which are the same for every backend.

    The example is an application that shows users registered in the backend, allows registration of
    new users, and shows how to login in separate tabs.

    Each backend contains the "users" object type, which defines a structure
    that stores all basic data about an application's users. The collection of "users" is not
    really different from any other collection. Therefore, we do not need any special
    methods to manipulate it. Typical data associated with a user is:
    \list
      \li \c username - required name used for logging in.
      \li \c email - unique email address of a user.
      \li \c firstName, lastName - user's credentials (optional).
      \li \c password - write-only property, this value is used during authentication.
    \endlist

    The \c users object can be extended by custom properties too.

    \note \e username and \e password are always required and cannot be empty.

    \section1 General Example Structure

    This example uses QtEnginio library together with Qt Quick Controls, therefore both have
    to be imported.

    \snippet users/Browse.qml imports

    We will also use a common \l {Enginio::EnginioClient}{EnginioClient} connection as shown here:

    \snippet users/users.qml client

    The example is organized into separate tabs by using \l TabView. Each tab shows a different
    functionality.

    \section1 Browsing User Data

    The most convenient method to browse users is to use \l{Enginio::EnginioModel}{EnginioModel}. The model can
    automatically download all data that we need. It is sufficient to set three properties:
    \l{Enginio::EnginioModel::client}{client}, \l{Enginio::EnginioModel::query}{query}
    and \l{Enginio::EnginioModel::operation}{operation} as shown below:

    \snippet users/Browse.qml browse

    The model is used directly by TableView, in which we define data that will be shown.

    \snippet users/Browse.qml columns

    \section1 User Authentication

    Authentication is quite easy. The only thing that needs to be done is to assign an identity, for example,
    \l{EnginioOAuth2Authentication}{EnginioOAuth2Authentication} object to \l{EnginioClient::identity}{EnginioClient::identity}.
    After a while, \l{EnginioClient::authenticationState}{EnginioClient::authenticationState} will change and
    \l{EnginioClient::sessionAuthenticated}{sessionAuthenticated} or \l{EnginioClient::sessionAuthenticationError}{sessionAuthenticationError}
    will be emitted.

    The first thing we need to do is to create an identity object: \l{EnginioOAuth2Authentication}{EnginioOAuth2Authentication}

    \snippet users/Login.qml identity

    Then, depending on the state of the application, we assign the object to
    our enginioClient instance. There are four possible states, defined by
    \l{Enginio::AuthenticationState}. After assigning the Identity object,
    the state changes from the initial \c NotAuthenticated to \c Authenticating.

    \snippet users/Login.qml assignIdentity

    Once the authentication query has finished, the state changes to \c Authenticated or
    \c AuthenticationFailure depending on the authentication result. Null
    assignment to the \l{EnginioClient::identity}{identity} causes the session to terminate immediately:

    \snippet users/Login.qml assignNull

    For educational purposes, in the example we also show a log window with data attached to
    a session that is changing state.

    \snippet users/Login.qml connections

    \section1 Registering a New User

    Registration of a new user is as simple as adding a new object to the \c users collection. It can be achieved
    by using the \l{EnginioClient::create}{create} function, as shown below:

    \snippet users/Register.qml create

    We could also use the \l{Enginio::EnginioModel::append}{EnginioModel::append} method in the browsing example
    to accomplish the same task.

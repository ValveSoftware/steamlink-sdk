    \title Hierarchy Example (ActiveQt)

    \brief The Hierarchy example is shows how to write an in-process ActiveX
    control. The control is a QWidget subclass with child widgets
    that are accessible as sub-types.

    \snippet activeqt/hierarchy/objects.h 0
    The \c QParentWidget class provides slots to create a widget
    with a name, and to return a pointer to a named widget. The class
    declaration uses \c Q_CLASSINFO() to provide the COM identifiers for
    this class.

    \snippet activeqt/hierarchy/objects.cpp 0
    The constructor of QParentWidget creates a vertical box layout.
    New child widgets are automatically added to the layout.

    \snippet activeqt/hierarchy/objects.cpp 1
    The \c createSubWidget slot creates a new \c QSubWidget with
    the name provided in the parameter, and sets the label to that
    name. The widget is also shown explicitly.

    \snippet activeqt/hierarchy/objects.cpp 2
    The \c subWidget slot uses the \c QObject::child() function and
    returns the first child of type \c QSubWidget that has the requested
    name.

     \snippet activeqt/hierarchy/objects.h 1
    The \c QSubWidget class has a single string-property \c label,
    and implements the paintEvent to draw the label. The class uses
    again \c Q_CLASSINFO to provide the COM identifiers, and also sets
    the \e ToSuperClass attribute to \e QSubWidget, to ensure that only
    no slots of any superclasses (i.e. QWidget) are exposed.

    \snippet activeqt/hierarchy/objects.cpp 3
    \snippet activeqt/hierarchy/objects.cpp 4
    The implementation of the QSubWidget class is self-explanatory.

    \snippet activeqt/hierarchy/main.cpp 0
    The classes are then exported using a QAxFactory. \c QParentWidget is
    exported as a full class (which can be created ), while \c QSubWidget is
    only exported as a type, which can only be created indirectly through
    APIs of \c QParentWidget.

    To build the example you must first build the QAxServer library.
    Then run qmake and your make tool in \c activeqt/hierarchy.

    The \l{qaxserver-demo-hierarchy.html}{demonstration} requires
    your WebBrowser to support ActiveX controls, and scripting to be
    enabled.

    \title Qt UI Tools

    \brief Provides classes to handle forms created with Qt Designer.

    \section1 Getting Started

    Qt Designer forms are processed at run-time to produce dynamically-generated
    user interfaces. In order to generate a form at run-time, a resource
    file containing a UI file is needed. Applications that use the
    form handling classes need to be configured to be built against the
    Qt UI Tools module. This is done by including the following declaration
    in a \c qmake project file to ensure that the application is compiled
    and linked appropriately.

    A form loader object, provided by the QUiLoader class, is used to construct
    the user interface. This user interface can be retrieved from any QIODevice.
    For example, a QFile object can be used to obtain a form stored in a
    project's resources. The QUiLoader::load() function takes the user interface
    description contained in the file and constructs the form widget.

    To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the following
    directive:

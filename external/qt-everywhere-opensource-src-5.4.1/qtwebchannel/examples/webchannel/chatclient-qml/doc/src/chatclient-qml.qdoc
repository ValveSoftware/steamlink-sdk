    \title Qt WebChannel Chatclient QML Example
    \ingroup qtwebchannel-examples
    \brief A QML client that communicates over a WebSocket with a QWebChannel server.

    The chatclient-html example provides a simple QWebChannel client implemented using JavaScript and QML.

    \section1 Overview

    The client initializes a WebSocket connection to the chat server and receives an object
    containing all neccessarry signals, slots and properties for implementing a chat client.

    After login, the client can invoke the method \c sendMessage and receive the signal \c newMessage
    to send and receive messages. Furthermore, there is a \c userList property which provides the
    names of all other connected clients. It is automatically updated when its contents change.
    Also, the client responds to the servers keep alive signal which is needed to detect disconnected
    clients and remove them from the \c userList property.

    The example shows how basic elements can be used with the client JavaScript implementation of
    QWebChannel, like connecting to signals (\c newMessage), calling slots (\c sendMessage) and handle
    property changes (\c userList).

    The client is able to work with the chatserver-cpp as server application


    The example can be run by invoking \c {path/to/qmlscene qmlchatclient.qml}.

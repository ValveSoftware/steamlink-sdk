    \title Qt WebChannel Chatserver Example
    \ingroup qtwebchannel-examples
    \brief Shows how to use the QWebChannel C++ API to implement a simple chat server

    The chatserver examples provides a chat service that client examples can connect to.

    \section1 Overview

    The C++ application implements a QObject which provides all mechanisms required for
    a chat service.
    This object is published through a QWebChannel which uses a WebSocket as transport.

    The server provides a basic \c login method (username only, no passwords), which must be
    successfully invoked before a client is able to chat.
    After login a client can invoke the method \c sendMessage and receive the signal \c newMessage
    to write and receive messages. Furthermore there is a \c userList property which provides
    the names of all other connected clients.
    Additionally the server sends a keepAlive signal periodically to all clients. The clients
    have to respond to this signal, otherwise the client will be removed from the \c userList property.

    The example shows how basic QObject elements can be used with QWebChannel, i.e. signals
    (\c newMessage), slots (\c sendMessage) and properties (\c userList).

    Because this is a plain server application, there are separated clients needed to interact
    with the server. Both examples chatclient-qml and chatclient-html show a client implementation
    compatible with this server.

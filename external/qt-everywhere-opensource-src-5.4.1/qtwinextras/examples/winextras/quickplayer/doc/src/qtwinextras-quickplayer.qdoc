    \brief Demonstrates using QtWinExtras in Qt Quick.

    The Quick Player example demonstrates how to use the various features
    provided by the QtWinExtras module in Qt Quick.

    \note This example is a simplified Qt Quick-based version of the \l {Music Player} example.

    \section1 DWM Features

    The example uses Windows DWM (Desktop Window Manager) features to visually
    integrate the window content to the window frame and to make the window
    translucent and blurred.

    The example applies a different look based on whether composition is enabled
    or not. When composition is enabled, the window is made translucent and
    the window frame is extended to the client area to make the window content
    integrate seamlessly to the window frame as shown above.

    When composition is disabled, the colorization color is used as a background
    color for the window.

    The following screenshot illustrates how the Quick Player example looks when
    composition is disabled.

    \section1 Taskbar Overlay and Progress

    The example uses Windows Taskbar for two things; it sets an overlay icon
    that represents the current music playback state, and it indicates the
    playback progress in the taskbar button.

    The following snippet shows how the taskbar button is prepared. The taskbar progress
    indicator and the overlay icon are bound to the music playback, and will automatically
    change whenever the state or attributes of the music playback change.

    \section1 Thumbnail Toolbar

    The Windows Thumbnail Toolbar is used for providing basic music playback
    controls. These controls can be used to control the application without
    having to activate the application. The thumbnail toolbar buttons are bound
    to the music playback, and will automatically change whenever the state or
    attributes of the music playback changes.

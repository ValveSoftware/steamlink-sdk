    \brief Demonstrates managing Windows DWM features, jump lists,
           taskbar button overlay, and thumbnail toolbar.

    The Music Player example demonstrates how to use the various features
    provided by the QtWinExtras module.

    \note The example uses QMediaPlayer from the QtMultimedia module to play
    the music, but this article focuses on the parts where QtWinExtras features
    are used.

    \section1 DWM Features

    The example uses Windows DWM (Desktop Window Manager) features to visually
    integrate the window content to the window frame and to make the main window
    and the volume popup translucent and blurred.

    The example applies a different look based on whether composition is enabled
    or not. When composition is enabled, the main window is made translucent and
    the window frame is extended to the client area to make the window content
    integrate seamlessly to the window frame as shown above. When composition
    is disabled, the colorization color is used as a background color. The
    following screenshot illustrates how the Music Player example looks when
    composition is disabled.

    The respective code is a combination of extending or resetting the system
    frame, adjusting the necessary QWidget attributes, and setting an appropriate
    style sheet to achieve the desired look.

    \snippet musicplayer/musicplayer.cpp 1

    The volume popup does not have a window frame so it is enough to make the
    popup blurred when composition is enabled. Additionally, a style sheet is
    applied to get a border that follows the colorization color. Just like for
    the main window, when composition is disabled, the colorization color is
    used as a background color.

    \snippet musicplayer/volumebutton.cpp 0

    The example application respects the user's composition settings, reacts
    to dynamic composition changes, and looks solid regardless of whether
    composition is enabled or not. It accomplishes this by catching
    QWinEvent::CompositionChange and QWinEvent::ColorizationChange events
    and adjusting its looks accordingly.

    \section1 Jump List

    The example creates a custom jump list to provide the user with fast
    access to recently played music files.

    \snippet musicplayer/musicplayer.cpp 4

    To enable the application jump list to show the desired recent files,
    the corresponding file types are registered using the following helper
    function.

    \snippet musicplayer/main.cpp 0

    \section1 Taskbar Overlay and Progress

    The example uses Windows Taskbar for two things; it sets an overlay icon
    that represents the current music playback state, and it indicates the
    playback progress in the taskbar button.

    \image qtwinextras-musicplayer-taskbar.png Screenshot of the Music Player taskbar

    The following snippet shows how the taskbar button is prepared. The playback
    progress is wired directly to the taskbar progress indicator by using signals
    and slots.

    \snippet musicplayer/musicplayer.cpp 5

    The overlay icon and the progress indicator are updated whenever the state
    of the music playback changes.

    \snippet musicplayer/musicplayer.cpp 2

    \section1 Thumbnail Toolbar

    \image qtwinextras-musicplayer-thumbnail.png Screenshot of the Music Player thumbnail

    The Windows Thumbnail Toolbar is used for providing basic music playback
    controls. These controls can be used to control the application without
    having to activate the application.

    \snippet musicplayer/musicplayer.cpp 6

    The buttons in the thumbnail toolbar are updated accordingly whenever the state
    of the music playback changes.

    \snippet musicplayer/musicplayer.cpp 3

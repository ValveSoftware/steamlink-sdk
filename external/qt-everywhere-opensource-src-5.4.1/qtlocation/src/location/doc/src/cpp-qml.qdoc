\title Interfaces between C++ and QML Code in Qt Positioning

\brief Some of the location QML types providing interfaces to access and modify properties in C++.

\section2 Category - QPlaceCategory
\target category
The \l {Category::category} {Category.category} property is used to provide an interface between C++ and QML code.  First a pointer to a
Category object must be obtained from C++, then use the \l {QObject::property()}{property()} and
\l {QObject::setProperty()}{setProperty()} functions to get and set the \c category property.
The following gets the QPlaceCategory representing this object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp Category get
The following sets the properties of this object based on a QPlaceCategory object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp Category set


\section2 ContactDetail - QDeclarativeContactDetail
\target contact_detail
The \l {ContactDetail::contactDetail} {ContactDetail.contactDetail} property is used to provide an interface between C++ and QML code.  First a pointer to a ContactDetail object must be obtained from C++, then use the
\l {QObject::property()}{property()} and \l {QObject::setProperty()}{setProperty()} functions
to get and set the \c contactDetail property.
The following gets the QPlaceContactDetail representing this object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp ContactDetail get
The following sets the properties of this object based on a QPlaceContactDetail object from
C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp ContactDetail set


\section2  Place - QPlace
\target place
The \l {Place::place} {Place.place} property is used to provide an interface between C++ and QML code.  First a pointer to a Place object must be obtained from C++, then use the
\l {QObject::property()}{property()} and \l {QObject::setProperty()}{setProperty()} functions
to get and set the \c place property.
The following gets the QPlace representing this object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp Place get
The following sets the properties of this object based on a QPlace object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp Place set



\section2  PlaceAttribute - QPlaceAttribute
\target placeattribute
The \l {PlaceAttribute::attribute} {PlaceAttribute.attribute} property is used to provide an interface between C++ and QML code.  First a pointer to a
PlaceAttribute object must be obtained from C++, then use the
\l {QObject::property()}{property()} and \l {QObject::setProperty()}{setProperty()} functions
to get and set the \c attribute property.
The following gets the QPlaceAttribute representing this object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp PlaceAttribute get
The following sets the properties of this object based on a QPlaceAttribute object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp PlaceAttribute set


\section2 Icon - QPlaceIcon
\target placeicon
The \l {Icon::icon} {Icon.icon} property is used to provide an interface between C++ and QML code.  First a pointer to a Icon object must be obtained from C++, then use the \l {QObject::property()}{property()} and
\l {QObject::setProperty()}{setProperty()} functions to get and set the \c icon property.
The following gets the QPlaceIcon representing this object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp Icon get
The following sets the properties of this object based on a QPlaceIcon object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp Icon set


\section2 User - QPlaceUser
\target placeuser
The \l {User::user} {User.user} property is used to provide an interface between C++ and QML code.  First a pointer to a
User object must be obtained from C++, then use the \l {QObject::property()}{property()} and
\l {QObject::setProperty()}{setProperty()} functions to get and set the \c user property.
The following gets the QPlaceUser representing this object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp User get
The following sets the properties of this object based on a QPlaceUser object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp User set


\section2 Ratings - QPlaceRatings
\target placeratings
The \l {Ratings::ratings} {Ratings.ratings} property is used to provide an interface between C++ and QML code.  First a pointer to a
Ratings object must be obtained from C++, then use the \l {QObject::property()}{property()} and
\l {QObject::setProperty()}{setProperty()} functions to get and set the \c ratings property.
The following gets the QPlaceRating representing this object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp Ratings get
The following sets the properties of this object based on a QPlaceRatings object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp Ratings set


\section2 Supplier - QPlaceSupplier
\target placesupplier
The \l {Supplier::supplier} {Supplier.supplier} property is used to provide an interface between C++ and QML code.  First a pointer to a
Supplier object must be obtained from C++, then use the \l {QObject::property()}{property()} and
\l {QObject::setProperty()}{setProperty()} functions to get and set the \c supplier property.
The following gets the QPlaceSupplier representing this object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp Supplier get
The following sets the properties of this object based on a QPlaceSupplier object from C++:
\snippet cpp/cppqml.cpp Supplier set

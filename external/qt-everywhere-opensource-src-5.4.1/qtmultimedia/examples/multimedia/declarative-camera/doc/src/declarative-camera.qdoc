\section1 Application Structure

Most of the QML code supports the user interface for this application with the
camera types being mostly found in \e {declarative-camera.qml} and
\e {CaptureControls.qml}.

CaptureControls, which is implemented in \e {CaptureControls.qml},
generates a column on the right hand side of the screen which includes control
buttons for focus (not initially visible), capture, flash modes,
white balance, exposure compensation, and if a preview is
available, a preview button. The last button exits from the application.

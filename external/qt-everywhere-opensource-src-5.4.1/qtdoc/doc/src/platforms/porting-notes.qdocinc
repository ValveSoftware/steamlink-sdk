//! [using resources]
    Like most UI applications, Qt applications also depend on resources such as
    images, icons, translation files, and so on. These resources must be made
    available on the device as they are required for the application to function
    correctly.

    The most convenient option is to bundle the resources into a qrc file,
    which gets built into the application binary. This approach reduces the porting
    effort considerably and provides faster access to the resources. It is
    also a cross-platform approach, which makes porting to other platforms easier.

    By default, all Qt applications can access the contents of a qrc file using
    the ":/" prefix or the URL scheme prefix, "qrc:". To know more about qrc files
    and how they are handled, see \l{The Qt Resource System}{the Qt Resource System}.

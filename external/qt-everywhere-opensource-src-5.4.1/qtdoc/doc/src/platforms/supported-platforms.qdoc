    \title Supported Platforms
    \brief The platforms supported by Qt.

    Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework. Using Qt,
    you can write GUI applications once and deploy them
    across desktop, mobile and embedded operating systems without
    rewriting the source code.In Qt 5 all platforms are created using
    the new \l{Qt Platform Abstraction} (QPA), which makes it easier
    than before to port Qt into a new operating system.

    Qt is supported on a variety of 32-bit and 64-bit platforms,
    and can usually be built on each platform with GCC, a vendor-supplied
    compiler, or a third party compiler. Open GL (ES) 2.0 or
    DirectX 9 (with ANGLE) is required for Qt Quick 2. Widgets and
    Qt Quick 1 can be used also without hardware acceleration.

    \section1 Desktop Platforms

    You can develop with Qt on the following desktop platforms:

    \list
        \li \l{Qt for Windows}{Windows}
        \li \l{Qt for Linux/X11}{Linux/X11}
        \li \l{Qt for OS X}{OS X}
    \endlist

    \section1 Embedded Platforms

        \li \l{Windows CE - Introduction to using Qt}{Windows Embedded (Compact and Standard)}
        \li Real-Time Operating Systems, such as \l{QNX}, VxWorks and INTEGRITY
    \endlist

    \section1 Mobile Platforms

    You can develop with Qt for the following mobile platforms supported
    by Digia:

        \li \l{Qt for iOS}{iOS}
        \li \l{Qt for WinRT}{WinRT} (including Windows Phone)
    \endlist

    The following platforms also support Qt:

    \list
        \li \l{Qt for BlackBerry 10}{BlackBerry 10}
        \li \l{Sailfish OS}
    \endlist

    Work in progress ports of Qt exist for:

    \endlist

    For more information about the Qt modules for mobile platforms, visit
    the \l{Mobile APIs} page.

    \section1 Reference Configurations

    A \e {reference configuration} is a combination of an operating system version,
    a compiler version, and a graphics system. The following table lists the
    configurations that are tested by the Qt Project:

    \table
    \header \li Platform
                                     \li Compiler
    \row    \li Ubuntu Linux 11.10, X11 (32-bit and 64-bit)
                                     \li As provided by Ubuntu
    \row    \li Ubuntu Linux 12.04, X11 (64-bit)
                                     \li As provided by Ubuntu
    \row    \li RedHat 6.5, X11 (64-bit)
                                     \li As provided by Red Hat
    \row    \li openSUSE 13.1, X11 (64-bit)
                                     \li As provided by SUSE
    \row    \li Microsoft Windows 7 (32-bit)
                                     \li MSVC 2010 SP1
    \row    \li Microsoft Windows 7 (32-bit)
                                     \li \l{http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win32/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/4.9.1/threads-posix/dwarf/i686-4.9.1-release-posix-dwarf-rt_v3-rev2.7z/download}{MinGW-builds gcc 4.9.1 (32-bit)}
    \row    \li Microsoft Windows 8.1 (32-bit and 64-bit)
                                     \li MSVC 2012 SP2
    \row    \li Microsoft Windows 8.1 (32-bit and 64-bit)
                                     \li MSVC 2013 SP3
    \row    \li Microsoft Windows Phone 8.1 (64-bit)
                                     \li MSVC 2013 SP3
    \row    \li Microsoft Windows Runtime 8.1 (64-bit)
                                     \li MSVC 2013 SP3
    \row    \li Apple OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion", Cocoa (64-bit)
                                     \li Clang as provided by Apple
    \row    \li Apple OS X 10.9 "Mavericks", Cocoa (64-bit)
                                     \li Clang as provided by Apple
    \row    \li Apple OS X 10.10 "Yosemite", Cocoa (64-bit)
                                     \li Clang as provided by Apple
    \row    \li Apple iOS 8 (64-bit)
                                     \li Clang as provided by Apple
    \row    \li Google Android 4.4
                                     \li As provided by Google (Android NDK Revision 10c)
    \endtable

    These reference configurations are run on the continuous integration (CI)
    system within Qt Project. In addition, they are subjected to unit test suite
    and other internal testing tools on a frequent basis (prior to new version
    releases, source tree branching, and at other significant period points in
    the development process). Errors or bugs discovered in these platforms are
    prioritized for correction. Significant errors discovered in tested
    configurations can impact release dates.

    Any configurations not listed above are not actively tested by the Qt
    Project. However, Qt may run on configurations other than those actively
    tested on, and additional configurations may be raised to tested state, if
    sufficient effort is made to bring continuous integration to an acceptable
    state for that particular configuration.

    In addition to the reference platforms Qt is occasionally tested on other
    configurations in which it is known to run well. These include, for example:

    \table
    \header \li Platform
                                     \li Compiler
    \row    \li Ubuntu Linux 10.04, X11 (32-bit)
                                     \li As provided by Ubuntu
    \row    \li Microsoft Windows XP (32-bit)
                                     \li MSVC 2008 SP1
    \row    \li Microsoft Windows CE 7.0
                                     \li MSVC 2008 SP1
    \row    \li Apple OS X 10.7 "Lion", Cocoa (64-bit)
                                     \li Clang as provided by Apple
    \endtable

    Digia, Qt partners, open source projects and community users
    are able to provide assistance with various different supported
    platforms and configurations.

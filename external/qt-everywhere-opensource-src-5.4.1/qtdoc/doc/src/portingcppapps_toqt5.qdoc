\title Porting C++ Applications to Qt 5
\brief Provides instructions to migrate a Qt 4 C++ application to Qt 5.

This topic talks about the Qt Widgets and Qt WebKit changes in Qt 5. The
following step-by-step instructions take you through the changes required to
port the \l{Animated Tiles Example}{Animated Tiles} application to Qt 5:

\list 1
   \li Open the Animated Tiles project using Qt Creator.
   \li Edit \c {main.cpp} and replace the \c {#include <QtGui>} instance with
       \c {#include <QtWidgets>}.
   \li Edit the \c {animatedtiles.pro} and add \c {QT += widgets} towards the
       end of the file.
       \note \l{Qt GUI} is included by default in all Qt applications unless excluded using the \c {QT -= gui} directive in the \c{qmake} project file.
   \li Save the changes and run the application.
\endlist

Once you see the application running, check whether it behaves as expected.

A similar change is needed to port Qt 4 C++ applications using Qt WebKit. The following
step-by-step instructions take you through the changes required to achieve this:

\list 1
   \li Open your project using Qt Creator.
   \li Replace all \c {#include <QtWebKit>} instances with
       \c {#include <QtWebKitWidgets>} in your project source.
   \li Edit the \c{.pro} file and add \c {QT += webkitwidgets}.

       \note If the \c {QT +=} statement already exists, append \c webkitwidgets
       to it.
   \li Save changes and run your application.
\endlist

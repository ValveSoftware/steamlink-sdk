    \title Third-Party Licenses Used in Qt
    \ingroup licensing
    \brief License information for third-party libraries supplied with Qt.

    Qt includes a number of third-party libraries that are used to provide
    certain features. Unlike the code described in the
    \l{Other Licenses Used in Qt}{code used in Qt} document, these
    libraries are supplied alongside the Qt modules.

    Third Party Software may impose additional restrictions and it is the
    user's responsibility to ensure that they have met the licensing
    requirements of the LGPL or Qt Commercial license and the relevant
    license of the Third Party Software they are using.

    Run \c{configure -help} to see any options that may be available for
    controlling the use of these libraries.

    Modifications, if any, done to the third-party libraries can
    normally be found by reviewing the change history of the
    corresponding files in the public Qt repository.

    \section1 FreeType 2 (freetype) version 2.3.12

    \e{The FreeType project is a team of volunteers who develop free, portable
    and high-quality software solutions for digital typography. We specifically
    target embedded systems and focus on bringing small, efficient and
    ubiquitous products.} -- quoted from \c 3rdparty/freetype/docs/freetype2.html.

    See \c qtbase/src/3rdparty/freetype/docs/FTL.txt and \c
    qtbase/src/3rdparty/freetype/docs/GPL.txt for license details.

    See also the files in \c qtbase/src/3rdparty/harfbuzz, which are used by
    FreeType.

    Parts of the FreeType projects have been modified and put into Qt
    for use in the painting subsystem. These files are ftraster.h,
    ftraster.c, ftgrays.h and ftgrays.c. The following modifications
    has been made to these files:

    \list
    \li Renamed FT_ and ft_ symbols to QT_FT_ and qt_ft_ to avoid name
    conflicts.
    \li Removed parts of code not relevant when compiled with
    _STANDALONE_ defined.
    \li Changed behavior in ftraster.c to follow X polygon filling
    rules.
    \li Implemented support in ftraster.c for winding / odd even
    polygon fill rules.
    \li Replaced bitmap generation with span generation in ftraster.c
    \li Renamed: ftraster.h to qblackraster_p.h
    \li Renamed: ftraster.c to qblackraster.c
    \li Renamed: ftgrays.h to qgrayraster_p.h
    \li Renamed: ftgrays.c to qgrayraster.c

    \section1 The Public Suffix List

    \e{The Public Suffix List is an initiative of the Mozilla Project, but is
       maintained as a community resource. It is available for use in any
       software, but was originally created to meet the needs of browser
       manufacturers. It allows browsers to, for example:}
    \list
    \li \e{Avoid privacy-damaging "supercookies" being set for high-level
          domain name suffixes}
    \li \e{Highlight the most important part of a domain name in the user
          interface}
    \li \e{Accurately sort history entries by site}
    \endlist

    The public suffix list is used inside Qt to avoid such "supercookies"
    mentioned above being set in the cookie jar supported by Qt (by the
    QNetworkCookieJar class).

    See \c qtbase/src/network/access/qnetworkcookiejartlds_p.h.INFO for more
    information about how the list is used.


    \section1 IAccessible2 IDL Specification

    \e{IAccessible2 is a new accessibility API which complements
       Microsoft's earlier work on MSAA. This API fills critical accessibility
       API gaps in the MSAA offering. IAccessible2 was created out of necessity
       to produce a usable and accessible OpenDocument Format (ODF) based
       office suite for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. IAccessible2 is an
       engineered accessibility interface allowing application developers to
       leverage their investment in MSAA while also providing an Assistive
       Technology (AT) access to rich document applications such as the IBM
       Workplace productivity editors and web browsers such as Firefox. The
       additional functionality includes support for rich text, tables,
       spreadsheets, Web 2.0 applications, and other large mainstream
       applications.}

    \section1 Clucene Core Library

    \e{CLucene is a C++ port of Lucene.  It is a high-performance, full-
    featured text search engine written in C++. CLucene is faster than lucene
    as it is written in C++.}
    -- quoted from \c qttools/src/assistant/3rdparty/clucene/README.


    The CLucene Core Library uses a dual license strategy for the source code.
    These licenses are the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and the Apache
    License (Version 2.0). Users can choose the license they wish to distribute
    their software under. This means that you do not need to abide by *both*
    licenses, but rather than you can choose the license which most suits your
    needs.

    To rephrase this and to make it perfectly clear:
    CLucene is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)
            *or*
    the Apache License, Version 2.0

    However, we are an open source project, and we encourage users to use the LGPL
    license and participate fully in the free software community. Dual licensing
    of the CLucene source code provides open and free access to the technology both
    for the GPL community and for other developers or companies that cannot use the
    GPL.

    You can freely modify, extend, and improve the CLucene source code. The only
    question is whether or not you must provide the source code and contribute
    modifications to the community. The GNU and Apache licenses allow different
    ranges of flexibility in this regard, but in the end, regardless of the license
    used, we highly recommend that you submit any bugs, incompatibilities or
    added features.

    Note that this same license does *not* apply to the CLucene Contributions
    package. You should read the COPYING file in that directory or package for
    more information.

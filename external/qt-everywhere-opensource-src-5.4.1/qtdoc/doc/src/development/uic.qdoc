    \omit KEEP THIS FILE SYNCHRONIZED WITH uic.1 \endomit

    This page documents the \e{User Interface Compiler} for the \l{Qt Widgets}
    toolkit. The \c uic reads an XML format user interface definition
    (\c .ui) file as generated by \l{Qt Designer Manual}{Qt
    Designer} and creates a corresponding C++ header file.

    Usage:
    \snippet snippets/code/doc_src_uic.qdoc 0

    \section1 Options

    The following table lists the command-line options recognized by
    \c uic.

    \table
    \header \li Option \li Description
    \row \li \c{-o <file>} \li Write output to \c <file> instead of to standard output.
    \row \li \c{-tr <func>} \li Use \c <func> for translating strings instead of \c tr().
    \row \li \c{-p} \li Don't generate guards against multiple inclusion (\c #ifndef FOO_H ...).
    \row \li \c{-h} \li Display the usage and the list of options.
    \row \li \c{-v} \li Display \c{uic}'s version number.
    \endtable

    \section1 Examples

    If you use \c qmake, \c uic will be invoked automatically for
    header files.

    Here are useful makefile rules if you only use GNU make:

    \snippet snippets/code/doc_src_uic.qdoc 1

    If you want to write portably, you can use individual rules of the
    following form:

    \snippet snippets/code/doc_src_uic.qdoc 2

    You must also remember to add \c{ui_foo.h} to your \c HEADERS
    (substitute your favorite name).

    \title CMake Manual

    \c {CMake} is a tool that helps simplify the build process for
    development projects across different platforms.  \c{CMake}
    automates the generation of buildsystems such as Makefiles and Visual Studio project
    files.

    \c{CMake} is a 3rd party tool with its own \l{CMake Documentation}{documentation}.
    The rest of this manual details the specifics of how to use Qt 5 with \c{CMake}.
    The minimum version required to use Qt5 is \c{CMake} 2.8.3, but 2.8.11 is recommended.

    \section1 Getting Started

    The first requirement when using \c{CMake} is to use \c{find_package} to locate the libraries
    and header files shipped with Qt. These libraries and header files can then be used
    to build libraries and applications based on Qt.

    The recommended way to use Qt libraries and headers with \c{CMake} 2.8.11 is to use
    the \c{target_link_libraries} command. In \c{CMake} 2.8.11 and later versions, this
    command automatically adds appropriate include directories, compile definitions, the
    position-independent-code flag, and links to the qtmain.lib library on Windows.

    To build a helloworld GUI executable, typical usage would be:

    \snippet snippets/cmake/CMakeLists.pro 0

    Note that setting the minimum required CMake version to 2.8.11 is required for
    automatic linking to the qtmain.lib library on Windows.

    In order for \c{find_package} to be successful, Qt 5 must be found below the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH,
    or the Qt5<Module>_DIR must be set in the \c{CMake} cache to the location of the
    Qt5WidgetsConfig.cmake file. The easiest way to use \c{CMake} is to set the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
    environment variable to the install prefix of Qt 5.

    The CMAKE_AUTOMOC setting runs moc automatically when required. For more on this feature see
    the \l{CMake AUTOMOC documentation}

    \section2 Imported targets

    Imported targets are created for each Qt module. Imported target names should be preferred instead of
    using a variable like Qt5<Module>_LIBRARIES in CMake commands such as \c{target_link_libraries}.
    The actual path to the library can be obtained using the \l{CMake LOCATION Documentation}{LOCATION property}:

    \snippet snippets/cmake/CMakeLists.pro 1

    Note however that it is rare to require the full location to the library in \c{CMake} code. Most
    \c{CMake} APIs are aware of imported targets and can automatically use them instead of the full path.

    Each module in Qt 5 has a library target with the naming convention Qt5::<Module> which can be used for
    this purpose.

    Imported targets are created with the configurations Qt was configured with. That is, if Qt was
    configured with the -debug switch, an imported target with the configuration DEBUG will be created. If
    Qt was configured with the -release switch an imported target with the configuration RELEASE will be
    created. If Qt was configured with the -debug-and-release switch (the default on windows), then
    imported targets will be created with both RELEASE and DEBUG configurations.

    If your project has custom CMake build configurations, it may be necessary to set a mapping from your
    custom configuration to either the debug or release Qt configuration.

    \snippet snippets/cmake/CMakeLists.pro 2

    Plugins are also available as \c IMPORTED targets in CMake. The \l{Qt
    Network}, \l{Qt SQL}, \l{Qt GUI}, and \l{Qt Widgets} modules have plugins
    associated. They provide a list of plugins in the
    \c{Qt5}\e{<Module>}\c{_PLUGINS} variable.

    \snippet snippets/cmake/CMakeLists.pro 7

    \section2 Using Qt 5 with \c{CMake} older than 2.8.11

    The recommended way to use Qt libraries and headers with \c{CMake} prior to 2.8.11 is to use
    the \c{qt5_use_modules} macro.

    Note that it is necessary to use \c{find_package} to find a Qt module before using the macro.
    See the documentation for the
    \l{CMake find_package Documentation}
    command for the full options it supports.

    The \c{qt5_use_modules} macro encapsulates all of the variable usage required to use a Qt module.
    It automatically finds the modules given to it on the command line if they have not already been found.

    \snippet snippets/cmake/CMakeLists.pro 3

    \section2 Using Qt 5 with \c{CMake} older than 2.8.9

    If using \c{CMake} older than 2.8.9, the \c{qt5_use_modules} macro is not available. Attempting to use it
    will result in an error.

    To use Qt 5 with versions of \c{CMake} older than 2.8.9, it is necessary to use the
    \c{target_link_libraries}, \c{include_directories}, and \c{add_definitions} commands, and to manually
    specify moc requirements with either \c{qt5_generate_moc} or \c{qt5_wrap_cpp}:

    \snippet snippets/cmake/CMakeLists.pro 4

    It is also necessary when using an older \c{CMake} to add Qt5<Module>_EXECUTABLE_COMPILE_FLAGS to
    the CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS so that the -fPIE flags are added to the compile flags if necessary (as
    is the default with Qt 5).

    If not using the \c{qt5_use_modules} macro, and if using CMake 2.8.9 or later, the
    \l{CMake POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE Documentation}{POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property} can be set on
    targets using Qt instead, or it can be set globally for all targets. Note that this is not necessary
    with CMake 2.8.11:

    \snippet snippets/cmake/CMakeLists.pro 5

    Note that it may be necessary to enable POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE globally in order to use try_compile
    with Qt code, or any wrapper macros around it such as check_cxx_source_compiles etc.
    As position independent code is a platform-specific and Qt-configuration-specific concept, the
    Qt5_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE property can be used to check whether it is required.

    \snippet snippets/cmake/CMakeLists.pro 6

    \section1 Variable Reference

    \section2 Module variables

    The result of a \c{find_package} call is that imported targets will be created for
    use with \c{target_link_libraries}, some variables will be populated with
    information required to configure the build, and macros will be made available
    for use. The name of the imported target for each module matches the name of the module with a
    prefix of 'Qt5::', for example Qt5::Widgets. All of the package-specific variables have a
    consistent name with a prefix of the name of the package. For example,
    \c{find_package}(Qt5Widgets) will make the following variables available if successfully found:

    \list
    \li Qt5Widgets_VERSION_STRING
    \li Qt5Widgets_LIBRARIES List of libraries for use with the target_link_libraries command, for example.
    \li Qt5Widgets_INCLUDE_DIRS List of libraries for use with the include_directories command, for example.
    \li Qt5Widgets_DEFINITIONS List of definitions for use with add_definitions, for example.
    \li Qt5Widgets_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS List of definitions for use with the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS target property.
    \li Qt5Widgets_FOUND Boolean describing whether the module was found successfully.
    \li Qt5Widgets_EXECUTABLE_COMPILE_FLAGS String of flags to be used when building executables.
    \endlist

    Equivalents of those variables will be available for all packages found with a \c{find_package} call. Note
    that the variables are case-sensitive.

    \section2 Installation variables

    Additionally, several other variables are available which do not relate to a particular package, but to the
    Qt installation itself.

    \list
    \li QT_VISIBILITY_AVAILABLE Boolean describing whether Qt was built with hidden visibility.
    \li QT_LIBINFIX String containing the infix used in library names.
    \endlist

    \section1 Macro Reference

    \section2 Qt5Core macros

    Macros available when Qt5Core is found.

    \table
    \header \li Macro \li Description
    \row \li qt5_wrap_cpp(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
         \li Create moc code from a list of files containing Qt class with
             the Q_OBJECT declaration.  Per-direcotry preprocessor definitions
             are also added.  Options may be given to moc, such as those found
             when executing "moc -help".
    \row \li qt5_add_resources(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
         \li Create code from a list of Qt resource files.
             Options may be given to rcc, such as those found
             when executing "rcc -help"
    \row \li qt5_generate_moc(inputfile outputfile )
         \li Creates a rule to run moc on infile and create outfile.
             Use this if for some reason QT5_WRAP_CPP() isn't appropriate, e.g.
             because you need a custom filename for the moc file or something similar.
    \row \li qt5_use_modules(target [LINK_PUBLIC|LINK_PRIVATE] module ... )
         \li Indicates that the target uses the named Qt 5 modules. The target
             will be linked to the specified modules, use the include directories
             installed by those modules, use the COMPILE_DEFINITIONS set by those
             modules, and use the COMPILE_FLAGS set by the modules. The LINK_PRIVATE
             or LINK_PUBLIC specifiers can optionally be specified. If LINK_PRIVATE is specified
             then the modules are not made part of the link interface of the target.
             See the documentation for
             \l{CMake target_link_libraries Documentation}{target_link_libraries}
             for more information.

             Note that this macro is only available if using \c{CMake} 2.8.9 or later.
             This macro is obsolete. Use target_link_libraries with IMPORTED targets instead.
    \endtable

    \section2 Qt5Widgets macros

    Macros available when Qt5Widgets is found.

    \table
    \header \li Macro \li Description
    \row \li qt5_wrap_ui(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
         \li Create code from a list of Qt designer ui files.
             Options may be given to uic, such as those found
             when executing "uic -help"
    \endtable

    \section2 Qt5DBus macros

    Macros available when Qt5DBus is found.

    \table
    \header \li Macro \li Description
    \row \li qt5_add_dbus_interface(outfiles interface basename)
         \li Create the interface header and implementation files with the
             given basename from the given interface xml file and add it to
             the list of sources

    \row \li qt5_add_dbus_interfaces(outfiles inputfile ... )
         \li Create the interface header and implementation files
             for all listed interface xml files
             the name will be automatically determined from the name of the xml file

    \row \li qt5_add_dbus_adaptor(outfiles xmlfile parentheader parentclassname [basename] [classname])
         \li Create a dbus adaptor (header and implementation file) from the xml file
             describing the interface, and add it to the list of sources. The adaptor
             forwards the calls to a parent class, defined in parentheader and named
             parentclassname. The name of the generated files will be
             <basename>adaptor.{cpp,h} where basename defaults to the basename of the xml file.
             If <classname> is provided, then it will be used as the classname of the
             adaptor itself.

    \row \li qt5_generate_dbus_interface( header [interfacename] OPTIONS ...)
         \li Generate the xml interface file from the given header.
             If the optional argument interfacename is omitted, the name of the
             interface file is constructed from the basename of the header with
             the suffix .xml appended.
             Options may be given to qdbuscpp2xml, such as those found when executing "qdbuscpp2xml --help"
    \endtable

    \section2 Qt5LinguistTools macros

    Macros available when Qt5LinguistTools is found.

    \table
    \header \li Macro \li Description
    \row \li qt5_create_translation( qm_files directories ... sources ...
                                  ts_files ... OPTIONS ...)
         \li Out: qm_files
             In:  Directories sources ts_files
             Options: flags to pass to lupdate, such as -extensions to specify
             Extensions for a directory scan.
             Generates commands to create .ts (vie lupdate) and .qm
             (via lrelease) - files from directories and/or sources. The ts files are
             created and/or updated in the source tree (unless given with full paths).
             The qm files are generated in the build tree.
             Updating the translations can be done by adding the qm_files
             to the source list of your library/executable, so they are
             always updated, or by adding a custom target to control when
             they get updated/generated.

    \row \li qt5_add_translation( qm_files ts_files ... )
         \li Out: qm_files
             In:  ts_files
             Generates commands to create .qm from .ts - files. The generated
             filenames can be found in qm_files. The ts_files
             must exist and are not updated in any way.

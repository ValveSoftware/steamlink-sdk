\title User Interfaces
\brief Qt's features for creating user interfaces

Qt features multiple technologies for creating user interfaces. While it is
possible to mix and match these different technologies as needed, one approach
is often better suitable for a certain type of user interface than the others.
\l {Qt Creator} is a good example of an application that mixes different user
interface technologies. In fact, it uses all of the three different approaches
described below. \l {Qt Creator} uses the traditional \l {Qt Widgets} such as
menus and dialogs as a basis of the user interface, \l {Qt Quick} amongst others
for the welcome screen, and \l {Qt WebKit} for presenting the Qt reference
documentation. The following sections provide brief introductions to the
available technologies for creating user interfaces, and a comparison table
to help choosing the best suitable technology.

\section2 Common Important UI Topics

\list
\li \l{highdpi.html}{High DPI Displays}
\endlist

\section1 QML Graphical User Interfaces

QML allows developers to build user interfaces in a declarative way. User
interfaces specifically benefit from the simplicity of compounding QML objects
and configuring them using property bindings.

\l{Qt Quick} is a module which supplies QML types for creating user interfaces
such as a visual canvas with its own coordinate system and rendering engine.
Animation and transition effects are a first class concept in Qt Quick and
visual effects can be supplemented through specialized components for particle
and shader effects.

\li \l{qtquick-usecase-text.html}{Displaying Text in QML}

\li \l{qtquick-usecase-styling.html}{Style and Theme Support}
\li \l{qtquick-usecase-integratingjs.html}{Integrating JavaScript in QML}
\li \l{Scalability}
\endlist

\section2 Graphical Controls

The \l{Qt Quick Controls} module is new in Qt 5.1 and provides a
set of UI elements to create user interfaces using \l{Qt Quick} 2.

For more about how to create application user interfaces with QML, visit the
\l{QML User Interfaces} page.

\section1 Widget-based User Interfaces

\l {Qt Widgets} are traditional user interface elements that are typically found
in desktop environments. The widgets integrate well to the underlying platform
providing native look'n'feel on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX. The widgets are mature
and feature rich user interface elements suitable for mostly static user interfaces.
In contrast to \l {Qt Quick}, the widgets do not scale that well for touch screens
and fluid, highly animated modern user interfaces. The widgets are a good choice
for applications with traditional desktop centric user interfaces, such as office
type applications.

\li \l{richtext.html}{Rich Text Processing}
\li \l{dnd.html}{Drag and Drop}
\li \l{Internationalization with Qt}{Internationalization}
\endlist

\section1 Displaying Web Content


Qt provides both \l{http://www.webkit.org/}{WebKit}-based and Chromium-based
(\l{Qt WebEngine}{WebEngine}) layout engines, which enable you to embed web content
into the Qt application. These engines provide both QML and C++ alternatives.

For more information about support for web content in Qt, see
\l{Integrating Web Content}.

\section1 Comparison

Notice that choosing the appropriate technology for building an user interface
is not always black and white, but may depend on several criterias, such as other
existing technologies used in a project or even target platform constraints. To
some extent, many items in the following table can be implemented using any of
the three available technologies. The following table merely aims to help you
choose the best suited tool for the job.

        \li Qt Widgets provide means for customization via style sheets,
            but Qt Quick is a better performing choice for user interfaces
            that do not aim to look native.

        \li X
        \li
        \li
        \li Qt Widgets do not scale well for animations, and Qt WebKit's CSS3
            animations are not as powerful as Qt Quick animations. Qt Quick
            offers a convenient and natural way to implement animations in a
            declarative manner.

        \li Touch screen
        \li X

        \li Qt Widgets often require a mouse cursor for good interaction, whereas
            Qt Quick only provides primitive building blocks that were designed
            with touch interaction in mind.
            The WebView Qt Quick component has support for multi-touch gestures

            and interact with web content.

            and Qt WebKit supports WebGL, but the OpenGL ES 2.0 or OpenGL 2.0
            based \l {Qt Quick Scene Graph} has proven to provide the best
            performance for UIs and for integrating with OpenGL content.

        \li
        \li
        \li The particle system and shader effects available in Qt Quick
            are more flexible compared to CSS Effects and Shaders available
            in Qt WebKit. Qt Widgets offer very little in this area.

        \li X
        \li
        \li Qt Widgets currently provide the most comprehensive base for implementing
            text editors. Qt's rich text document classes can also be utilized in
            Qt Quick and Qt Quick Controls' TextArea, but may require some C++
            implementation.
    \row
        \li Existing web content
        \li
        \li
        \li X
        \li Both Qt Quick and Qt Widgets prodive components for presenting
            \l {richtext-html-subset.html}{simple rich text}, but Qt WebKit
            is the right choice for presenting full-blown web content.

Qt provides excellent support for translating applications into local languages.
Release managers, translators, and developers can use Qt translation tools to
accomplish their tasks.

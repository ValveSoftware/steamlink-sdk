    \title Qt Quick Layouts

    \brief A module with a set of QML elements that arrange QML items in a user interface.

    Qt Quick Layouts are a set of QML types used to arrange items in a user interface. In contrast
    to \l{Item Positioners}{positioners}, Qt Quick Layouts can also resize their items. This makes
    them well suited for resizable user interfaces. Since layouts are items they can consequently
    be nested.

    The module is new in Qt 5.1 and requires \l{Qt Quick} 2.1.

    Visit the \l{Qt Quick Layouts Overview} page to get started.

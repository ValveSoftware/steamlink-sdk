    \title The Webkit Bridge Tutorial - Hybrid Client Application
    \brief Demonstrates how to integrate web functionality with other core
           functionality.
    \ingroup webkit-widgetexamples

    In this example, we will show how to write a hybrid application using
\l{The Qt WebKit Bridge}{Qt WebKit Bridge}, which distinguishes itself from a
thin client in that it performs heavy calculations on the client side in C++,
like a native application, but presents nothing more than a \c QWebView for its
user interface, displaying web content written in HTML/JavaScript. The
application uses QtConcurrent to distribute its work across as many CPU cores as
are available from the system, so it can process each image in parallel.

For the full reference documentation of QtWebKit hybrid development, see
\l{qtwebkit-bridge.html}{The Qt WebKit Bridge}.

Initially, you will see a user interface with an empty list of images. Clicking
on some of the images in the lower pane below adds them to the list view above,
as shown in the screenshot below.

    \image webkit-imageanalyzer-screenshot.png

Now, we can click on \b Analyze, and each image is analyzed using some
computationally intensive C++ function, in parallel and on different cores.
Progress is shown while the analysis is proceeding.

    \image webkit-imageanalyzer-progress.png

and in the end, we will see something like this, where the average RGB values of
each image are shown.

    \image webkit-imageanalyzer-complete.png

The MainWindow is defined in C++, and creates a \l QNetworkDiskCache and a
\l QWebView, and tells the \l QWebView to load the starting page, providing us
with a user interface for the client.

  \snippet webkitwidgets/imageanalyzer/mainwindow.cpp MainWindow - constructor

In this example, the sample content is addressed with the \tt qrc:/index.html
URL. \tt qrc:/ indicates that the file is stored as a Qt resource (attached to
the executable). In a real-world application, the content and images would
likely be retrieved from the network rather than from resources.

We wish to initialize an object reference in the JavaScript web page to point
to our \tt ImageAnalyzer before any other scripts are run. To do this, we
connect the \l{QWebFrame::}{javaScriptWindowObjectCleared()} signal to a slot
which does the object creation and handoff to JavaScript.

  \snippet webkitwidgets/imageanalyzer/mainwindow.cpp MainWindow - addJSObject

The ImageAnalyzer object is created and added to a JavaScript object on the web
page's mainFrame with \c addToJavaScriptWindowObject().

    The start page is resources/index.html.
    In one of its <div> regions, we have images, each
    with an \c onClick() handler that calls \c addImage().

    \snippet webkitwidgets/imageanalyzer/resources/index.html sample images

Clicking an image adds it to an images list.

    \snippet webkitwidgets/imageanalyzer/resources/index.html addImage

The \b {Analyze} button at the bottom of the image list is clicked when we
want to start the analysis:

    \snippet webkitwidgets/imageanalyzer/resources/index.html images list

When the user clicks the \b {Analyze} button, \c analyzeImages() is called,
another regular JavaScript method, shown below.
Notice it assumes the \c imageAnalyzer object is already defined and initialized
in JavaScript space, but we guaranteed that by connecting our setup slot to the
appropriate signal, \l{QWebFrame::}{javaScriptWindowObjectCleared()}.

    \snippet webkitwidgets/imageanalyzer/resources/index.html analyzeImages

The only methods on \c ImageAnalyzer that we can or do call from JavaScript are
those which are exposed through \{The Meta-Object System}{Qt's MetaObject}
system: \l{The Property System}{property} getter/setter methods,
\c public \l {Signals & Slots}{signals and slots}, and other
\l{Q_INVOKABLE}{Q_INVOKABLE} functions.

\snippet webkitwidgets/imageanalyzer/imageanalyzer.h ImageAnalyzer - public interface
\dots
\snippet webkitwidgets/imageanalyzer/imageanalyzer.h ImageAnalyzer - private members

Most of the members are set up in the constructor:

\snippet webkitwidgets/imageanalyzer/imageanalyzer.cpp ImageAnalyzer - Constructor

Back on the JavaScript side, we want to connect signals from this object to
JavaScript functions on our web page, after the web page is loaded, but before
the images are analyzed.

From \c connectSlots(), we can see how to connect signals from the imageAnalyzer
object to regular JavaScript functions, which can also behave like slots. We use
this to monitor and display progress from the C++ side.

    \snippet webkitwidgets/imageanalyzer/resources/index.html connect slots

The only public slot is \c startAnalysis(), called to place
a list of URLs into the image analyzer's QtConcurrent processing queue
from JavaScript space.

\snippet webkitwidgets/imageanalyzer/imageanalyzer.cpp ImageAnalyzer - startAnalysis

The images need to be loaded again now, which is why fetchURLs first checks the
cache to see if we can save an extra network get.

\snippet webkitwidgets/imageanalyzer/imageanalyzer.cpp ImageAnalyzer - fetchURLs

For the images that were not in the cache, \c handleReply()
will load them into a QImage when the data is ready.

\snippet webkitwidgets/imageanalyzer/imageanalyzer.cpp ImageAnalyzer - handleReply

After the images are loaded, they are queued up in preparation to be
sent in a batch for analysis to a \l QFutureWatcher, which will distribute the
processing across multiple threads and cores, depending on how many are available.

\snippet webkitwidgets/imageanalyzer/imageanalyzer.cpp ImageAnalyzer - queueImage

The function that gets performed on each image is \c averageRGB(),
as specified in argument 2 to the \l{QtConcurrent::mapped()} function.
Notice it repeats the same calculations 100 times on each pixel to keep the CPU
very busy. This is done only for the purposes of the demo so that the analysis
takes a noticeable time to complete.

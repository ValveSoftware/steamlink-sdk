    \title Flickr View Example
    \brief Demonstrates how to embed a web view in a Qt Quick application
    \ingroup webkit-qmlexamples

    The Flickr View Qt Quick example uses a \l{WebView} to browse the images
    from the \l{http://flickr.com}{Flickr} public RSS feed.

    \image flickrview-example.png

    FlickrView is an example that retrieves the \l{http://www.flickr.com/services/feeds/docs/photos_public}{flickr.com RSS feed of public photos}
    utilizing an \l{XmlListModel} and shows the thumbnails in a \l{ListView}.
    When clicking on a thumbnail in the list at the bottom, the full size
    image is loaded in a \l{WebView} using the corresponding Flickr link for it.
    It is also possible to browse the profile of Flickr users in the WebView like in a
    normal browser. This demonstrates how navigaton can be restricted to a specific
    domain in the \c{onNavigationRequested} signal.
    The feed can be updated using pull-to-refresh at the end of the thumbnail list.

    This example uses the QtWebKit QML API that utilizes the WebKit2 split-process architecture.

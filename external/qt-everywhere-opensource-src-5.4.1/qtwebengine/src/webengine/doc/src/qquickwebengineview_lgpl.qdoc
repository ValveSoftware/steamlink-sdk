    \title Qt WebEngine

    The Qt WebEngine module provides the WebEngineView API which allows QML applications
    to render regions of dynamic web content. A \e{WebEngineView} component may share
    the screen with other QML components or encompass the full screen as
    specified within the QML application.

    It allows an application to load pages into the WebEngineView, either by URL or with
    an HTML string, and navigate within session history. By default,
    links to different pages load within the same WebEngineView, but web sites may
    request them to be opened as a new tab, window or dialog.

    The following sample QML application loads a web page, responds to session
    history context.

    \code
    import QtQuick 2.1
    import QtQuick.Controls 1.1
    import QtWebEngine 1.0

    ApplicationWindow {
        width: 1280
        height: 720
        visible: true
        WebEngineView {
            id: webview
            url: "http://www.qt-project.org"
            anchors.fill: parent
        }
    }
    \endcode

/*!
    \qmlmethod void WebEngineView::goBack()

    Go backward within the browser's session history, if possible.
    This function is equivalent to the \c{window.history.back()} DOM method.

    \sa WebEngineView::canGoBack
*/

/*!
    \qmlmethod void WebEngineView::goForward()

    Go forward within the browser's session history, if possible.
    This function is equivalent to the \c{window.history.forward()} DOM method.
*/

/*!
    \qmlmethod void WebEngineView::stop()

    Stops loading the current page.
*/

/*!
    \qmlmethod void WebEngineView::reload()

    Reloads the current page. This function is equivalent to the
    \c{window.location.reload()} DOM method.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty url WebEngineView::url

    The location of the currently displaying HTML page. This writable
    property offers the main interface to load a page into a web view.
    It functions the same as the \c{window.location} DOM property.

    \sa WebEngineView::loadHtml()
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty url WebEngineView::icon
    \readonly

    This property holds the location of the currently displaying web site icon,
    also known as favicon or shortcut icon. This read-only URL corresponds to
    the image used within a mobile browser application to represent a
    bookmarked page on the device's home screen.

    The following snippet uses the \c{icon} property to build an \c{Image}
    component:

    \code
    Image {
        id: appIcon
        source: webView.icon != "" ? webView.icon : "fallbackFavIcon.png";
        ...
    }
    \endcode
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty int WebEngineView::loadProgress

    This property holds the amount of the page that has been loaded, expressed
    as an integer percentage in the range from \c{0} to \c{100}.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool WebEngineView::canGoBack

    Returns \c{true} if there are prior session history entries, \c{false}
    otherwise.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool WebEngineView::canGoForward

    Returns \c{true} if there are subsequent session history entries,
    \c{false} otherwise.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty bool WebEngineView::loading

    Returns \c{true} if the HTML page is currently loading, \c{false} otherwise.
*/

/*!
    \qmlproperty string WebEngineView::title
    \readonly

    This property holds the title of the currently displaying HTML page, a
    read-only value that reflects the contents of the \c{<title>} tag.
*/

/*!
    \qmlmethod void WebEngineView::loadHtml(string html, url baseUrl)
    \brief Loads the specified \a html as the content of the web view.

    This method offers a lower-level alternative to the \c{url} property,
    which references HTML pages via URL.

    External objects such as stylesheets or images referenced in the HTML
    document should be located relative to \a baseUrl. For example, if \a html
    is retrieved from \c http://www.example.com/documents/overview.html, which
    is the base url, then an image referenced with the relative url, \c diagram.png,
    should be at \c{http://www.example.com/documents/diagram.png}.

    \sa WebEngineView::url
*/


/*!
    \qmlmethod void WebEngineView::runJavaScript(string script, variant callback)
    \brief Runs the specified \a script in the content of the web view.

    In case a callback function is provided it will be invoked after the script
    finished running.

    \code
    runJavaScript("document.title", function(result) { console.log(result); });

Name: Network Security Services (NSS)
URL: http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/
Version: 3.15.5 Beta 2
Security Critical: Yes
License: MPL 2
License File: NOT_SHIPPED

This directory includes a copy of NSS's libssl from the hg repo at:
  https://hg.mozilla.org/projects/nss

The same module appears in crypto/third_party/nss (and third_party/nss on some
platforms), so we don't repeat the license file here.

The snapshot was updated to the hg tag: NSS_3_15_5_BETA2

Patches:

  * Cache the peer's intermediate CA certificates in session ID, so that
    they're available when we resume a session.
    patches/cachecerts.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=731478

  * Add support for client auth with native crypto APIs on Mac and Windows.
    patches/clientauth.patch
    ssl/sslplatf.c

  * Add a function to export whether the last handshake on a socket resumed a
    previous session.
    patches/didhandshakeresume.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=731798

  * Add function to retrieve TLS client cert types requested by server.
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=51413
    patches/getrequestedclientcerttypes.patch

  * Add a function to restart a handshake after a client certificate request.
    patches/restartclientauth.patch

  * Add support for TLS Channel IDs
    patches/channelid.patch

  * Add support for extracting the tls-unique channel binding value
    patches/tlsunique.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=563276

  * SSL_ExportKeyingMaterial should get the RecvBufLock and SSL3HandshakeLock.
    This change was made in https://chromiumcodereview.appspot.com/10454066.
    patches/secretexporterlocks.patch

  * Change ssl3_SuiteBOnly to always return PR_TRUE. The softoken in NSS
    versions older than 3.15 report an EC key size range of 112 bits to 571
    bits, even when it is compiled to support only the NIST P-256, P-384, and
    P-521 curves. Remove this patch when all system NSS softoken packages are
    NSS 3.15 or later.
    patches/suitebonly.patch

  * Define the SECItemArray type and declare the SECItemArray handling
    functions, which were added in NSS 3.15. Remove this patch when all system
    NSS packages are NSS 3.15 or later.
    patches/secitemarray.patch

  * Update Chromium-specific code for TLS 1.2.
    patches/tls12chromium.patch

  * Add Chromium-specific code to detect AES GCM support in the system NSS
    libraries at run time. Remove this patch when all system NSS packages are
    NSS 3.15 or later.
    patches/aesgcmchromium.patch

  * Support ChaCha20+Poly1305 ciphersuites
    http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-agl-tls-chacha20poly1305-01
    patches/chacha20poly1305.patch

  * Fix session cache lock creation race.
    patches/cachelocks.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=764646

  * Support the Certificate Transparency (RFC 6962) TLS extension
    signed_certificate_timestamp (client only).
    patches/signedcertificatetimestamps.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=944175

  * Add a function to allow the cipher suites preference order to be set.
    patches/cipherorder.patch

  * Add TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV cipher suite to version fallback connections.
    patches/fallbackscsv.patch

  * Add explicit functions for managing the SSL/TLS session cache.
    This is a temporary workaround until Chromium migrates to NSS's
    asynchronous certificate verification.
    patches/sessioncache.patch

  * Use NSSRWLock instead of PRRWLock in sslSessionID. This avoids the bugs
    in the lock rank checking code in PRRWLock.
    patches/nssrwlock.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=957812

  * Use the IANA-assigned value for the TLS padding extension.
    patches/paddingextvalue.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=994883

  * Move the signature_algorithms extension to the end of the extension list.
    This works around a bug in WebSphere Application Server 7.0 which is
    intolerant to the final extension having zero length.
    patches/reorderextensions.patch

  * Ignore out-of-order DTLS ChangeCipherSpec.
    patches/ignorechangecipherspec.patch
    https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1009227

Apply the patches to NSS by running the patches/applypatches.sh script.  Read
the comments at the top of patches/applypatches.sh for instructions.

The ssl/bodge directory contains files taken from the NSS repo that we required
for building libssl outside of its usual build environment.

Current Status as of May 16, 2014

Upstream cherry-picks:

Current patches:

to_upstream/

ugly/
01_enable_checked_bitstream.patch
  dalecurtis: Removes "#define UNCHECKED_BITSTREAM_READER 1" from all codecs
  defining it. In Chromium, all codecs should use the safe bitstream reader.

02_compile_with_disabled_features.patch
  dalecurtis: Add CONFIG_* checks to compile out code which we don't use which
  might be a security risk.  Discuss with cevans before removing.  Upstream does
  not want this patch.
  wolenetz: In M27 merge, added call to matroska_read_close(s) in to this patch
  in matroska_read_header() to mitigate memory leak caught by valgrind.
  Confirmed with rbultje that this conforms to API (on error in
  matroska_read_header(), resulting state should be same as prior to call; and
  no double-free is expected to result from this either.)

preserve_m27_avcodecids.patch
  wolenetz: Insert a deprecated placeholder into AVCodecID enum such that
  the resulting IDs are either new IDs since M27 or have same enumeration as
  M27.  This is specific to the M29 roll.

w32pthreads_xp_fixes_and_vp8_workaround.patch
  dalecurtis: pthreads emulation incorrectly assumed Vista+.  Additionally due
  to use of static variables in header file, duplicate initialization is needed.
  reported upstream which is working on a proper fix.

"""Generate aggregate .cpp files that include multiple V8 binding .cpp files.

This can be a single output file, to preserve symbol space; or multiple output
files, to reduce maximum compilation unit size and allow parallel compilation.

Usage:
aggregate_generated_bindings.py COMPONENT_DIR IDL_FILES_LIST -- OUTPUT_FILE1 OUTPUT_FILE2 ...

COMPONENT_DIR is the relative directory of a component, e.g., 'core', 'modules'.
IDL_FILES_LIST is a text file containing the IDL file paths, so the command
line doesn't exceed OS length limits.
OUTPUT_FILE1 etc. are filenames of output files.

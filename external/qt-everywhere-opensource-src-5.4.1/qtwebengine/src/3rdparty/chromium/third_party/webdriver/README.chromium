Description:
  WebDriver is a clean, fast framework for automated testing of webapps.

Contents:
  python/
    Python bindings and tests for WebDriver pulled in via DEPS.

  test_data/
    Select files from http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/common/src/web.
    At revision 17149. Necessary data for running the python webdriver tests.

  atoms.h, atoms.cc
    These atoms are generated by the webdriver team and are to be checked in
    manually. The current version was generated from revision
    749d7ba2b1f402868f215b7bcc4b80e4e1b975a3.

    To generate the atoms using the code found in selenium tree:
      $ svn checkout http://selenium.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ selenium-read-only
      $ cd selenium-read-only
      $ go //javascript/chrome-driver:atoms
      $ cp build/javascript/chrome-driver/atoms.h \
           <chromium_dir>/src/third_party/webdriver/atoms.h
      $ cp build/javascript/chrome-driver/atoms.cc \
           <chromium_dir>/src/third_party/webdriver/atoms.cc

    The atoms.h/cc files are only used directly in the chrome version of
    webdriver found under the path src/chrome/test/chromedriver.

Local Modifications:
- Applied changes in patch.diff to the selenium tree prior to building the atoms.

Description:
Alternative to SQLite used as the backend for IndexedDB and internally by the
FileSystem API implementation and others.

Local Additions:
* gyp file for building in chromium
* port/port_chromium.{h,cc}, env_chromium.{h,cc}, env_chromium_stdio.{h,cc}, and
  env_chromium_win.{h,cc} provide (POSIX and Windows respectively) chromium
  implementations of primitives used by leveldb.  E.g. threading, file handling,
  etc. env_chromium.h allows re-use of some utility functions.
* chromium_logger.h was copied from src/util/posix_logger.h and updated to use
  chrome primitives in place of some posix primitives
* env_idb.h allows IndexedDB to emit uma stats under separate histograms from
  other LevelDB consumers.
* ChromiumEnv wraps low-level I/O calls that may be interrupted with a
  HANDLE_EINTR macro that retries the call.
* TRACE macros/thread name for chrome://tracing diagnostics
* Handle in-process exclusive file locks, based on src/util/env_posix.cc
* Unit tests for the Chromium environment.

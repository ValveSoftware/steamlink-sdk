    \class QWebEngineView
    \brief The QWebEngineView class provides a widget that is used to view and edit
    web documents.
    \ingroup advanced

    \inmodule QtWebEngineWidgets

    QWebEngineView is the main widget component of the Qt WebEngine web browsing module.
    It can be used in various applications to display web content live from the
    Internet.

    A web site can be loaded onto QWebEngineView with the load() function. Like all
    Qt widgets, the show() function must be invoked in order to display
    QWebEngineView. The snippet below illustrates this:

    \snippet snippets/simple/main.cpp Using QWebEngineView

    Alternatively, setUrl() can also be used to load a web site. If you have
    the HTML content readily available, you can use setHtml() instead.

    The loadStarted() signal is emitted when the view begins loading. The
    loadProgress() signal, on the other hand, is emitted whenever an element of
    the web view completes loading, such as an embedded image, a script, etc.
    Finally, the loadFinished() signal is emitted when the view has loaded
    completely. It's argument - either \c true or \c false - indicates
    load success or failure.

    The page() function returns a pointer to the web page object. See
    \l{Elements of QWebEngineView} for an explanation of how the web page
    is related to the view.

    The title of an HTML document can be accessed with the title() property.
    Additionally, a web site may also specify an icon, which can be accessed
    using the icon() property. If the title or the icon changes, the corresponding
    titleChanged() and iconChanged() signals will be emitted. The
    textSizeMultiplier() property can be used to change the overall size of
    the text displayed in the web view.

    If you require a custom context menu, you can implement it by reimplementing
    \l{QWidget::}{contextMenuEvent()} and populating your QMenu with the actions
    obtained from pageAction(). More functionality such as reloading the view,
    copying selected text to the clipboard, or pasting into the view, is also
    encapsulated within the QAction objects returned by pageAction(). These
    actions can be programmatically triggered using triggerPageAction().
    Alternatively, the actions can be added to a toolbar or a menu directly.
    QWebEngineView maintains the state of the returned actions but allows
    modification of action properties such as \l{QAction::}{text} or
    \l{QAction::}{icon}.

    If you want to provide support for web sites that allow the user to open
    new windows, such as pop-up windows, you can subclass QWebEngineView and
    reimplement the createWindow() function.

    \section1 Elements of QWebEngineView

    QWebEngineView contains a QWebEnginePage, which in turn allows access to the
    QWebEngineHistory in the page's context.

/*!
    \fn void QWebEngineView::setHtml(const QString &html, const QUrl &baseUrl)
    Sets the content of the web view to the specified \a html.

    External objects such as stylesheets or images referenced in the HTML
    document are located relative to \a baseUrl.

    The \a html is loaded immediately; external objects are loaded asynchronously.

    When using this method, Qt WebEngine assumes that external resources such as
    JavaScript programs or style sheets are encoded in UTF-8 unless otherwise
    specified. For example, the encoding of an external script can be specified
    through the charset attribute of the HTML script tag. Alternatively, the
    encoding can also be specified by the web server.

    This is a convenience function equivalent to setContent(html, "text/html", baseUrl).

    \warning This function works only for HTML, for other mime types (i.e. XHTML, SVG)
    setContent() should be used instead.

    Sets the content of the web view to the specified content \a data. If the \a mimeType argument
    is empty it is currently assumed that the content is HTML but in future versions we may introduce
    auto-detection.

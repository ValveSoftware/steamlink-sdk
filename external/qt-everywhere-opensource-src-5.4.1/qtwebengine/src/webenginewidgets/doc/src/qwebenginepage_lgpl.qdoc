    \class QWebEnginePage
    \brief The QWebEnginePage class provides an object to view and edit web documents.

    \inmodule QtWebEngineWidgets

    QWebEnginePage holds a main frame responsible for web content, the history
    of navigated links and actions.

    QWebEnginePage's API is very similar to QWebEngineView, as you are still provided with
    common functions like action() (known as
    \l{QWebEngineView::pageAction()}{pageAction}() in QWebEngineView), triggerAction(),
    and findText().

    A page can be loaded using load() or setUrl(). Alternatively, if you have
    the HTML content readily available, you can use setHtml() instead.

    The QWebEnginePage class also offers methods to retrieve both the URL currently
    loaded by its main frame (see url()) as well as the URL originally requested
    to be loaded (see requestedUrl()). These methods make possible the retrieval
    of the URL before and after a DNS resolution or a redirection occurs during
    the load process. The requestedUrl() also matches to the URL added to the
    page history (\l{QWebEngineHistory}) if load is successful.

    The title of an HTML page can be accessed with the title() property.
    Additionally, a page may also specify an icon, which can be accessed
    using the icon() property. If the title or the icon changes, the
    corresponding titleChanged() and iconChanged() signals will be emitted.
    The zoomFactor() property can be used to change the overall size
    of the content displayed in the page.

    The loadStarted() signal is emitted when the page begins to load.The
    loadProgress() signal, on the other hand, is emitted whenever an element
    of the web page completes loading, such as an embedded image, a script,
    etc. Finally, the loadFinished() signal is emitted when the page contents
    are loaded completely, independent of script execution or page rendering.
    Its argument, either true or false, indicates whether or not the load
    operation succeeded.

   \enum QWebEnginePage::FindFlag

   This enum describes the options available to the findText() function. The options
   can be OR-ed together from the following list:

   \value FindBackward Searches backwards instead of forwards.
   \value FindCaseSensitively By default findText() works case insensitive. Specifying this option
   changes the behavior to a case sensitive find operation.
*/

/*!
    \enum QWebEnginePage::WebAction

    This enum describes the types of action which can be performed on the web page.

    Actions only have an effect when they are applicable. The availability of
    actions can be be determined by checking \l{QAction::}{isEnabled()} on the
    action returned by action().

    \value NoWebAction No action is triggered.
    \value Back Navigate back in the history of navigated links.
    \value Forward Navigate forward in the history of navigated links.

/*!
    \fn void QWebEnginePage::javaScriptConsoleMessage(JavaScriptConsoleMessageLevel level, const QString& message, int lineNumber, const QString& sourceID)
    This function is called whenever a JavaScript program tries to print a \a message to the web browser's console.

    For example in case of evaluation errors the source URL may be provided in \a sourceID as well as the \a lineNumber.

    \a level indicates the severity of the event that triggered the message, i.e. if it
    was triggered by an error or a less severe event.

    The default implementation prints nothing.

/*!
    \fn void QWebEnginePage::javaScriptAlert(const QUrl &securityOrigin, const QString& msg)

    The default implementation shows the message, \a msg, with QMessageBox::information.
*/

/*!
    \fn bool QWebEnginePage::javaScriptConfirm(const QUrl &securityOrigin, const QString& msg)
    This function is called whenever a JavaScript program running in a frame affiliated with \a securityOrigin calls the confirm() function

    This function is called whenever a JavaScript program running in a frame affiliated with \a securityOrigin tries to prompt the user for input.
    The program may provide an optional message, \a msg, as well as a default value for the input in \a defaultValue.

    If the prompt was cancelled by the user the implementation should return false; otherwise the
    result should be written to \a result and true should be returned. If the prompt was not cancelled by the
    user, the implementation should return true and the result string must not be null.

    The default implementation uses QInputDialog::getText().

/*!
    \fn QWebEnginePage *QWebEnginePage::createWindow(WebWindowType type)
    This function is called whenever the WebEngine wants to create a new window of the given \a type, for example when a JavaScript program requests to open a document in a new window.

    If the new window can be created, the new window's QWebEnginePage is returned; otherwise a null pointer is returned.

    If the view associated with the web page is a QWebEngineView object, then the default implementation forwards
    the request to QWebEngineView's createWindow() function; otherwise it returns a null pointer.

    \note In the cases when the window creation is being triggered by JavaScript, apart from
    reimplementing this method application must also set the JavaScriptCanOpenWindows attribute
    of QWebEngineSettings to true in order for it to get called.

/*!
    \fn void QWebEnginePage::triggerAction(WebAction action, bool)
    This function can be called to trigger the specified \a action.

/*!
    \fn void QWebEnginePage::setHtml(const QString &html, const QUrl &baseUrl)
    Sets the content of this page's main frame to \a html. \a baseUrl is optional and used to resolve relative
    URLs in the document, such as referenced images or stylesheets.

    The \a html is loaded immediately; external objects are loaded asynchronously.

    If a script in the \a html runs longer than the default script timeout (currently 10 seconds),
    for example due to being blocked by a modal JavaScript alert dialog, this method will return
    as soon as possible after the timeout and any subsequent \a html will be loaded asynchronously.

    When using this method WebEngie assumes that external resources such as JavaScript programs or style
    sheets are encoded in UTF-8 unless otherwise specified. For example, the encoding of an external
    script can be specified through the charset attribute of the HTML script tag. It is also possible
    for the encoding to be specified by web server.

    This is a convenience function equivalent to setContent(html, "text/html", baseUrl).

    \note This method will not affect session or global history for the frame.

    \warning This function works only for HTML, for other mime types (i.e. XHTML, SVG)
    setContent() should be used instead.

    Sets the content of this page's main frame to the specified content \a data. If the \a mimeType argument
    is empty it is currently assumed that the content is HTML but in future versions we may introduce
    auto-detection.

    External objects referenced in the content are located relative to \a baseUrl.

    The \a data is loaded immediately; external objects are loaded asynchronously.

    \note This method will not affect session or global history for the frame.

    \note \a resultCallback can be any of a function pointer, a functor or a lambda, and it is expected to take a QVariant parameter.

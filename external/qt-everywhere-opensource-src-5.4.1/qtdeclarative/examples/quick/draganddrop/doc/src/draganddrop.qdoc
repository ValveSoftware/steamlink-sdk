    And a DropTile component which the dragged tiles can be dropped onto:

    \snippet draganddrop/tiles/DropTile.qml 0

    The keys property of the DropArea will only allow an item with a matching
    key in its Drag.keys property to be dropped on it.

    \section1 GridView

    \e GridView adds drag and drop to a \l GridView, allowing you to reorder the
    list. It also uses a \l DelegateModel to move a delegate item to the
    position of another item it is dragged over.

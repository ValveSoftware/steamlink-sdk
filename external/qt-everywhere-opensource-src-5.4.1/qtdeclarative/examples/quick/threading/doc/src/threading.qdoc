    \title Qt Quick Examples - Threading
    \example threading
    \brief This is a collection of QML multithreading examples.

    \ingroup qtquickexamples

    \e Threading is a collection of QML multithreading examples.

    \include examples-run.qdocinc

    \section1 Threaded ListModel

    \e{Threaded ListModel} contains a \l ListView and a \l ListModel.
    The ListModel object is updated asynchronously in another thread, and the
    results propagate back to the main thread. A timer requests updates from the
    worker thread periodically:
    \snippet threading/threadedlistmodel/timedisplay.qml 0

    Inside the worker thread, the ListModel is synchronized once the data is
    finished loading:
    \snippet threading/threadedlistmodel/dataloader.js 0

    \section1 WorkerScript

    \e WorkerScript contains an example of using a \l WorkerScript to offload
    expensive calculations into another thread. This keeps the UI from being
    blocked. This example calculates numbers in Pascal's Triangle, and not in a
    very optimal way, so it will often take several seconds to complete the
    calculation. By doing this in a WorkerScript in another thread, the UI is
    not blocked during this time.

    When the UI needs another value, a request is sent to the WorkerScript:
    \snippet threading/workerscript/workerscript.qml 0

    The workerscript then is free to take a really long time to calculate it:
    \snippet threading/workerscript/workerscript.js 0

    When it's done, the result returns to the main scene via the WorkerScript
    type:
    \snippet threading/workerscript/workerscript.qml 1

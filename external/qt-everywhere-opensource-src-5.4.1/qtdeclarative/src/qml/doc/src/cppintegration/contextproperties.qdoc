\title Embedding C++ Objects into QML with Context Properties
\brief Description of how to embed C++ data into QML using context properties

When loading a QML object into a C++ application, it can be useful to directly embed some C++ data
that can be used from within the QML code. This makes it possible, for example, to invoke a C++
method on the embedded object, or use a C++ object instance as a data model for a QML view.

The ability to inject C++ data into a QML object is made possible by the QQmlContext class. This
class exposes data to the context of a QML object so that the data can be referred to directly from
within the scope of the QML code.


\section1 Setting a Simple Context Property

For example, here is a QML item that refers to a \c currentDateTime value that does not exist in
the current scope:

\snippet qml/qtbinding/context/MyItem.qml 0

This \c currentDateTime value can be set directly by the C++ application that loads the QML
component, using QQmlContext::setContextProperty():

\snippet qml/qtbinding/context/main.cpp 0

\note Since all expressions evaluated in QML are evaluated in a particular context, if the context
is modified, all bindings in that context will be re-evaluated. Thus, context properties should be
used with care outside of application initialization, as this may lead to decreased application
performance.


\section1 Setting an Object as a Context Property

Context properties can hold either QVariant or QObject* values. This means custom C++ objects can
also be injected using this approach, and these objects can be modified and read directly in QML.
Here, we modify the above example to embed a QObject instance instead of a QDateTime value, and the
QML code invokes a method on the object instance:

\table
\row
\li
\snippet qml/qtbinding/context-advanced/applicationdata.h 0
\codeline
\snippet qml/qtbinding/context-advanced/main.cpp 0
\li
\snippet qml/qtbinding/context-advanced/MyItem.qml 0
\endtable

(Note that date/time values returned from C++ to QML can be formatted through
\l{QtQml::Qt::formatDateTime}{Qt.formatDateTime()} and associated functions.)

If the QML item needs to receive signals from the context property, it can connect to them using the
\l Connections type. For example, if \c ApplicationData has a signal named \c
dataChanged(), this signal can be connected to using an \c onDataChanged handler within
a \l Connections object:

\snippet qml/qtbinding/context-advanced/connections.qml 0

Context properties can be useful for using C++ based data models in a QML view. See the
following examples:
\list
    \li \l {Models and Views: String ListModel Example}{String ListModel}
    \li \l {Models and Views: Object ListModel Example}{Object ListModel}
    \li \l {Models and Views: AbstractItemModel Example}{AbstractItemModel}
\endlist

demonstrating the use of QStringList, QList<QObject*>-based models and
QAbstractItemModel in QML views.

Also see the QQmlContext documentation for more information.
